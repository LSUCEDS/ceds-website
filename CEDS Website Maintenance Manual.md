# Maintenance Manual

This is the manual for updating the CEDS website through the LSU Omni platform. The website is currently at [this URL](https://lsu.edu/_fierce-draft/_ceds/index.php).

The following pages on the CEDS website will need to be updated when new research, publications, tools, or other notable resources are completed and documented:
  - Research
  - Tools and Resources

Other pages, such as the people page will need to be updated less frequently when staff and research team members change. The documentation for maintenance is below. However, for some issues you may need to reach out to Lori Martin, Director of Digital Communications at **lkemp1@lsu.edu**.

# Omni Overview

Omni is a CMS, or content management system. Rather than doing all of the programming for a site by yourself line-by-line, a CMS allows you to publicly host your files online using preset page items, called snippets. Most of the time spent editing the website will be done through interacting with or making changes to snippets. In order to navigate to a page, you will need to click "Back to Pages" or navigate using the "Home" icon in the tope left-hand corner of the screen. The folders for each page are located at _fierce_draft/_ceds, where the following should be visible:

## Navigating the Directory

Each *index.pcf* file, one of which is visible in the picture above, is an editable file. The index file in each folder corresponds with the website page for that folder, so the index.pcf file in the research folder is the editable file for the Research page. The index file in picture is in the root directory and corresponds to the landing page for the site. Simply click on the index file you want to edit to be taken to that page.

## Navigating the Index File

The index files give you several options for that page. The tabs and buttons at the top of the screen have the following functions:
  - **Preview**: Shows the full page and how it will look on the site once published (since the last save).
  - **Edit**: Opens the page editor and allows you to add, delete, and move page information.
  - **Properties**: Gives you access to page properties and settings such as editable metadata, page descriptions, and tags for SEO.
  - **Versions**: Shows you a log of all saved edits to the site with the ability to restore any previously save version. The versions save automatically when you save each page but need to be restored manually. **Lori would be a good resource to use if you need to do this and need help!**
  - **Check In/Out**: Once an index file is opened in edit mode it is considered "checked out" by that user. Once it is checked out it is only accessible to that user and will need to be checked back in for others to use. This applies to all ITS and Digital Communications staff! They will not be able to troubleshoot a page if it is checked out by another user.
  - **Publish**: Publishing an updated page will share it with the world! **You will need to make sure to follow the accessibility guidelines outlined below!**

## Checking In and Out Pages

In order to check in a page, navigate to "My Dashboard" at the top of the screen and turn off the lightbulbs for each page you want to check in.
