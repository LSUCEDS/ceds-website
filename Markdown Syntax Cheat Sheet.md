**Adding two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase creates bold text.** To bold a **single** word, encapsulate only that word with two asterisks.

*You can do the same with italics using only one asterisk.* A single italic *word* works the same as well.

> Block quotes can be created using ">" before starting a new paragraph.
>> You can nest them too using ">>" for the paragraph you want to nest!
