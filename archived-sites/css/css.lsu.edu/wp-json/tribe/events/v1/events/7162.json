Woods Auditorium Energy, Coast, and Environment Building<\/p>\n<p>Abstract: In the shallows of San Francisco Bay, fringing marshes attenuate wave action by providing vegetative drag. This reduction in wave energy allows sediments to drop out of suspension and settle onto the marsh platform, where they contribute to vertical accretion and marsh sustainability. The ability to reduce wave energy also makes marshes an appealing option for nature-based coastal protection. For these applications and others, quantifying local attenuation and understanding its drivers is critical. For this talk, I will present results from two field campaigns at the China Camp State Park salt marsh in San Francisco Bay. Measurements were collected in winter 2014 and summer 2016.  We examined the within marsh variations of wave height and suspended sediment, as well as the seasonal variation driven by the differing weather regimes, wave climates, and vegetation characteristics. The nine Bay Area counties recently approved a measure to raise $25 million annually for tidal marsh restoration. As these funds are put to work, the results of this project help inform management plans and engineering designs.<\/p>\n<p>Bio: Madeline holds a degree in civil engineering from Cooper Union and is currently a PhD candidate in the Environmental Fluid Mechanics group at UC Berkeley. Influenced by growing up in South Louisiana, her work focuses on understanding physical processes underlying marsh functions. <\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"lsu-ccr-guest-speaker-madeline-foster-martinez","image":{"url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top.jpg","id":"7167","extension":"jpg","width":934,"height":467,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"width":600,"height":300,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-600x300.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":384,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-768x384.jpg"},"large":{"width":800,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-800x400.jpg"},"thumb_crop":{"width":200,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-200x200.jpg"},"small_crop":{"width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-300x200.jpg"},"medium_crop":{"width":600,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-600x400.jpg"},"large_crop":{"width":934,"height":400,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-934x400.jpg"},"book_cover":{"width":190,"height":290,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-190x290.jpg"},"page_featured_crop":{"width":430,"height":467,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-430x467.jpg"},"past_lecture_cat":{"width":200,"height":300,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/marsh-top-200x300.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2017-04-24 15:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"04","day":"24","hour":"15","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-04-24 17:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"04","day":"24","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2017-04-24 15:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"04","day":"24","hour":"15","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-04-24 17:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"04","day":"24","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+0","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":false,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":7066,"author":"8","status":"publish","date":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","date_utc":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","modified":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","modified_utc":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/venue\/dalton-j-woods-auditorium\/","venue":"Dalton J.
