The rising seas will not only require populations to retreat but will cause ecosystems to shift, <\/span>storm proofing<span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.15px;\"> to change, constructed landscapes to go to ruin and\/or require remediation, and coastal building sites to be addressed. It is also important to remember that with the sea comes <\/span>salt<span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.15px;\">, which will require structures to resist corrosion and that settlements\u2019 notions of <\/span>permanent<span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.15px;\"> ground will have to change. Historically and currently, humankind has inhabited the coastal environments of the Earth (39% as of 2010). Sea level rise and global climate shifts continue to exert changes upon these environments. These conditions all demand a rethinking of how one builds, environmentally, structurally, systematically, and architecturally. For her career at LSU, Professor Ursula Emery McClure has been investigating, researching, and designing for the coastal condition. A wide array of projects with her firm, her students, and her LSU <\/span>peers<span style=\"letter-spacing: 0.15px;\"> will be presented that examine the changing coastline and how change between land and sea is changing the way one inhabits the coast.<\/span><\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"lsu-cce-seminar-ursula-emery-mcclure","image":{"url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109.jpg","id":"7340","extension":"jpg","width":1140,"height":315,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"width":600,"height":166,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-600x166.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":212,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-768x212.jpg"},"large":{"width":1140,"height":315,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-1140x315.jpg"},"thumb_crop":{"width":200,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-200x200.jpg"},"small_crop":{"width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-300x200.jpg"},"medium_crop":{"width":600,"height":315,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-600x315.jpg"},"large_crop":{"width":1140,"height":315,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-1140x315.jpg"},"book_cover":{"width":190,"height":290,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-190x290.jpg"},"page_featured_crop":{"width":430,"height":315,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-430x315.jpg"},"past_lecture_cat":{"width":200,"height":300,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/LSU1109-200x300.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2019-03-22 11:30:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"03","day":"22","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-03-22 12:30:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"03","day":"22","hour":"12","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2019-03-22 11:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"03","day":"22","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-03-22 12:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"03","day":"22","hour":"12","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+0","timezone_abbr":"UTC+0","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Past Lecture","slug":"past-lecture","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":567,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":8,"filter":"raw","term_order":"0","id":567,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/567","collection":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":7066,"author":"8","status":"publish","date":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","date_utc":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","modified":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","modified_utc":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/venue\/dalton-j-woods-auditorium\/","venue":"Dalton J.
