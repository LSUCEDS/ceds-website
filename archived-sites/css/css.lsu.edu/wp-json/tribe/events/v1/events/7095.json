This approach is particularly useful to quantify risk and hurricane response to past climatic and oceanographic variability. In an effort to add to the expanding number of sites across the planet, we explore the potential of previously understudied environments capable of producing long-term hurricane records. We present several new Holocene paleotempestological records from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and North Atlantic margins. We discuss a multiproxy approach for many of the sites consisting of X-radiographs, X-ray fluorescence, micropaleontology, grain size measurements, and inverse sediment transport models in the context of Bayesian statistical age-depth relationships relying on short (annual) and long-term (millennia) radiometric dating techniques. By comparing these spatially and temporally varying records, we discuss regional and basin-wide storm trends, as well as local to global climatic implications.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"lsu-college-coast-environment-lecture-davin-wallace","image":{"url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/156441.jpg","id":"7096","extension":"jpg","width":190,"height":238,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/156441-150x150.jpg"},"thumb_crop":{"width":190,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/156441-190x200.jpg"},"small_crop":{"width":190,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/156441-190x200.jpg"},"book_cover":{"width":190,"height":238,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/156441-190x238.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2016-12-02 11:30:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"12","day":"02","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2016-12-02 12:15:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"12","day":"02","hour":"12","minutes":"15","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2016-12-02 11:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"12","day":"02","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2016-12-02 12:15:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"12","day":"02","hour":"12","minutes":"15","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+0","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":7066,"author":"8","status":"publish","date":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","date_utc":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","modified":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","modified_utc":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/venue\/dalton-j-woods-auditorium\/","venue":"Dalton J.
