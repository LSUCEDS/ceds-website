This is how she questions the meaning of town planning or urban design. To her point of view, town planning can&#8217;t be reduced to a strict instrumental and operational approach. That&#8217;s why she includes in her research the logics of inhabitants; the processes of deployment for project intentions; architectural, urban, and environmental experiences; as well as the complexity of methodological protocols. Dr. Buyck received her Master&#8217;s in Architecture in Strasbourg and her PHD in Aesthetic in Lille. Her international experience includes training in Rio de Janeiro and working a year in Brussels. As project manager of a well known French landscape architecture office, she has contributed to the development of numerous projects such as the international competition for greater Paris. Currently, Dr. Buyck is involved in various aspects of town planning. She leads research projects; participates in operational projects; works for the French Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy; organizes film festivals related to cities; and serves as an elected member of both local and national scientific authorities. Dr. Buyck also serves as Director of the \u00ab Urban Design \u00bb Master&#8217;s Degree Program.<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"css-brown-bag-lecture-visiting-faculty-jennifer-buyck","image":{"url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1.jpg","id":"7151","extension":"jpg","width":654,"height":328,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"width":600,"height":301,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1-600x301.jpg"},"thumb_crop":{"width":200,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1-200x200.jpg"},"small_crop":{"width":300,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1-300x200.jpg"},"medium_crop":{"width":600,"height":328,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1-600x328.jpg"},"book_cover":{"width":190,"height":290,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1-190x290.jpg"},"page_featured_crop":{"width":430,"height":328,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1-430x328.jpg"},"past_lecture_cat":{"width":200,"height":300,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1-200x300.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2017-03-08 12:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"03","day":"08","hour":"12","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-03-08 13:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"03","day":"08","hour":"13","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2017-03-08 12:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"03","day":"08","hour":"12","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-03-08 13:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"03","day":"08","hour":"13","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+0","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":7148,"author":"8","status":"publish","date":"2017-03-06 18:23:42","date_utc":"2017-03-06 18:23:42","modified":"2017-03-06 18:23:42","modified_utc":"2017-03-06 18:23:42","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/venue\/401-design-3\/","venue":"401 Design","slug":"401-design-3","address":"LSU: 401 Design","city":"Baton Rouge","country":"United States","zip":"70803","json_ld":{"@type":"Place","name":"401 Design","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"LSU: 401 Design","addressLocality":"Baton Rouge","postalCode":"70803","addressCountry":"United States"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"global_id":"css.lsu.edu?id=7148","global_id_lineage":["css.lsu.edu?id=7148"]},"organizer":[{"id":7149,"author":"8","status":"publish","date":"2017-03-06 18:23:42","date_utc":"2017-03-06 18:23:42","modified":"2017-03-06 18:23:42","modified_utc":"2017-03-06 18:23:42","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/organizer\/lsu-css-3\/","organizer":"LSU CSS","slug":"lsu-css-3","phone":"225-578-4990","website":"css.lsu.edu","email":"mberg41@lsu.edu","json_ld":{"@type":"Person","name":"LSU CSS","description":"","url":false,"telephone":"225-578-4990","email":"&#109;berg&#52;&#49;&#64;&#108;su.e&#100;u","sameAs":"http:\/\/css.lsu.edu"},"global_id":"css.lsu.edu?id=7149","global_id_lineage":["css.lsu.edu?id=7149"]}],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"CSS Brown Bag Lecture by Visiting Faculty, Jennifer Buyck","description":"&lt;p&gt;Cooperative Urban Design: Places, Moments, and Acts Make plans to attend this week\u2019s CSS Brown Bag Lecture by Jennifer Buyck, visiting faculty from Institut d\\'Urbanisme de Grenoble \u2013 Grenoble Planning Institute in France Wednesday, March 8 at NOON Design Building Room 401 (NOTE this venue is different from usual place!)... &lt;\/p&gt;\\n","image":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/image003-1.jpg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/event\/css-brown-bag-lecture-visiting-faculty-jennifer-buyck\/","startDate":"2017-03-08T12:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2017-03-08T13:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"401 Design","description":"","url":false,"address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"LSU: 401 Design","addressLocality":"Baton Rouge","postalCode":"70803","addressCountry":"United States"},"telephone":"","sameAs":""},"organizer":{"@type":"Person","name":"LSU CSS","description":"","url":false,"telephone":"225-578-4990","email":"mbe&#114;&#103;4&#49;&#64;ls&#117;&#46;&#101;d&#117;","sameAs":"http:\/\/css.lsu.edu"},"performer":"Organization"}}
