While the need to manage these flows is recognized, best management practices to reduce stream N concentrations have had only limited success. Some have attributed this lack of success to accumulation of legacy N stores from decades of fertilizer application. Here we use a coupled data-synthesis and modeling framework to (a) quantify the accumulated legacies in agricultural watersheds, and (b) model catchment scale time lags using both statistical and deterministic approaches. We analyze long-term soil data from the Mississippi River Basin to reveal significant increases in total N (TN) content, accounting for 43% of net anthropogenic N inputs. The presence of such legacy stores is utilized in the development of a framework for quantifying catchment-scale time lag times based on both soil nutrient accumulations and groundwater travel time distributions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Speaker Profile: Dr. Nandita Basu studies the water-quality impacts of climate, land-use and land-management across scales, with specific focus on quantifying how nutrients\/contaminants are transported from headwaters and through the river network. Her interest lies at the interface of humans and water systems, with the overall goal of providing innovative solutions for sustainable water management<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"lsu-college-coast-environment-special-seminar-nandita-basu","image":{"url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/dsc4342-1.jpg","id":"7084","extension":"jpg","width":220,"height":289,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/dsc4342-1-150x150.jpg"},"thumb_crop":{"width":200,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/dsc4342-1-200x200.jpg"},"small_crop":{"width":220,"height":200,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/dsc4342-1-220x200.jpg"},"book_cover":{"width":190,"height":289,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/dsc4342-1-190x289.jpg"},"past_lecture_cat":{"width":200,"height":289,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/dsc4342-1-200x289.jpg"}}},"all_day":false,"start_date":"2016-11-02 10:40:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"11","day":"02","hour":"10","minutes":"40","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2016-11-02 11:30:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"11","day":"02","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2016-11-02 10:40:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"11","day":"02","hour":"10","minutes":"40","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2016-11-02 11:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2016","month":"11","day":"02","hour":"11","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+0","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[],"tags":[],"venue":{"id":7066,"author":"8","status":"publish","date":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","date_utc":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","modified":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","modified_utc":"2016-10-25 16:09:05","url":"https:\/\/css.lsu.edu\/venue\/dalton-j-woods-auditorium\/","venue":"Dalton J.
