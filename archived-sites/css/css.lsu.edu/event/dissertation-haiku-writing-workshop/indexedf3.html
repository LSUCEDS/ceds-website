SUMMARY:Dissertation Haiku Writing Workshop
DESCRIPTION:LSU students\, faculty and staff will distill an account of a research project into the form of vivid haiku to be delivered at a special end of the year LSU Science Café poetry slam. The haiku\, a sparse Japanese poetic form\, conveys extensive information swiftly\, clearly and memorably. Being able to communicate concisely and effectively in today’s Age of Information is a crucial skill\, and there’s no better (or more fun) way to hone that skill than working with poetry. \nRegister for this research haiku writing workshop on Wed.\, 10/26 from noon-1pm at 129 Himes Hall. Students\, faculty and staff from various disciplines are welcome. \nPoetry slam participants will recite their haikus and compete for $750 research travel grants provided by the Office of Research & Economic Development on Tues.\, Nov. 29 at Schlittz & Giggles. Come celebrate the science of communication and the art of poetry with LSU’s McElveen Professor in English Laura Mullen\, who will be hosting this special event. \nRegister to attend the writing workshop today! \n
