SUMMARY:LSU CCE CEGO Seminar: Dr. Chunyan Li
DESCRIPTION:Dr. Chunyan Li\nDepartment of Oceanography & Coastal Sciences\nLSU \nDalton J. Woods Auditorium\nLSU Energy\, Coast & Environment Building\nJanuary 26\, 2018\n11:30 a.m \nFlows in shallow bays\, particularly those in a system with micro-tides\, are relevant to material transport in Louisiana estuaries and coastal waters. The physics dictates the mixing and re-suspension of materials including: bottom sediments and transport of freshwater\, suspended sediment\, dissolved organics\, fish larvae\, and nutrients. Despite the importance\, we have yet  to have a satisfactory collection of fundamental theories of flows in this kind of system\, even though many state-of-the-art  numerical models can produce realistic results. However\, our intellectual advancement\, not colorful model output (albeit needed and powerful)\, is oftentimes the key for decision making. This talk will make an attempt to present such theories and discuss potential applications based on data\, theoretical models\, and numerical model experiments. These “laws” are extremely important to our understanding of freshwater diversion and the fate of sediment plumes. \nLunch served for seminar attendees \n
