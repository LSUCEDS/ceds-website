SUMMARY:The Underwater Forest Film Screening + Q&A
DESCRIPTION:Geography & Anthropology’s Friday Forum Series Presents:\nThe Underwater Forest\nFilm Screening + Q&A\nFriday\, October 13\n3:30pm\nHowe-Russell E130\n \nThe Underwater Forest details the discovery and exploration of an ancient cypress forest found sixty feet underwater in the Gulf of Mexico\, due south of Gulf Shores\, Alabama. The forest dates to an ice age more than 60\,000 years ago\, when sea levels were about 400 feet lower than they are today. The forest appears to be a wholly unique relic of our planet’s past\, the only known site where a coastal ice age forest this old has been preserved in place. It is considered a treasure trove of information\, providing new insights into everything from climate in the region to annual rainfall\, insect populations\, and the types of plants that inhabited the Gulf Coast before humans arrived in the new world. Scientific analysis of the site is ongoing. \n \nThe documentary follows the work of the team investigating the site\, both underwater and in the laboratory. The film was written and directed by Ben Raines\, and features researchers from LSU\, including from the departments of Geography & Anthropology\, Geology and Geophysics\, the College of the Coast and Environment\, and the LSU Coastal Studies Institute.
