SUMMARY:LSU CCE Seminar: Ursula Emery McClure
DESCRIPTION:The College of the Coast & Environment  \nUpcoming Seminar: “C³_Coastal Construction Culture” \n \nSpeaker: Ursula Emery McClure\, LSU College of Art and Design \nFriday\, March 22\, 2019\n11:30 a.m. \nDalton J. Woods Auditorium\nLSU Energy\, Coast & Environment Building \nLunch served for attendees! \nThe global ramifications of sea level rise are much greater than merely changing coastlines. The rising seas will not only require populations to retreat but will cause ecosystems to shift\, storm proofing to change\, constructed landscapes to go to ruin and/or require remediation\, and coastal building sites to be addressed. It is also important to remember that with the sea comes salt\, which will require structures to resist corrosion and that settlements’ notions of permanent ground will have to change. Historically and currently\, humankind has inhabited the coastal environments of the Earth (39% as of 2010). Sea level rise and global climate shifts continue to exert changes upon these environments. These conditions all demand a rethinking of how one builds\, environmentally\, structurally\, systematically\, and architecturally. For her career at LSU\, Professor Ursula Emery McClure has been investigating\, researching\, and designing for the coastal condition. A wide array of projects with her firm\, her students\, and her LSU peers will be presented that examine the changing coastline and how change between land and sea is changing the way one inhabits the coast. \n
