Liz manages coastal grant-making areas with an advisory committee and relevant partners that work to help communities face a range of issues and challenges that range in scale from mega-regional networks and hydrologic basins to stormwater management and flood insurance.\nRisk mitigation and resilience-based programs require an awareness of and participation with these transitioning watersheds. In order to better provide opportunities\, establish and cultivate partnerships\, and advocate for informed and diverse public engagement\, Liz supports fundraising initiatives and guides the common campaign and funding plan across Foundation for Louisiana’s Coastal Resiliency Leverage Fund. \nLiz previously has worked as a Research Fellow and Affiliate with the Coastal Sustainability Studio at Louisiana State University. In this role she led and collaborated with cohorts of civil engineers\, urban planners\, coastal scientists\, and landscape architects alongside economic\, legal\, and cultural advisors. Each project engaged a set of unique conditions within the coastal landscape and proposed developments through which residents and communities might advance and thrive in a future with evolving challenges. \nIn addition to early years of experience within traditional architecture practice\, Liz has held a range of academic positions. She has taught within the School of Architecture at LSU\, the Department of Architecture and Landscape within the University of Greenwich in London\, London College of Contemporary Art\, and Birmingham City University in the UK. \n
