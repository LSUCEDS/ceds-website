SUMMARY:LSU CEGO Seminar: Dr. Emi Uchida
DESCRIPTION:\nThe College of the Coast & Environment proudly presents \n\nCEGO Seminar Series \nVulnerability of a coupled human-ecological system:\nCan mangrove ecosystem services strengthen resiliency of rural coastal communities? \nPresented by: \n \nDr. Emi Uchida\nDepartment of Environmental and Natural Resources Economics\nUniversity of Rhode Island \nDalton J. Woods Auditorium\nLSU Energy\, Coast & Environment Building\nNovember 16\, 2018\n11:30 a.m. \nChronic poverty and natural resource degradation are correlated and geographically concentrated in rural areas where livelihoods and basic needs depend disproportionately on natural resources and their ecosystem services. However\, the mechanisms through which chronic poverty and ecosystem services interact are not well understood. This study uncovers four possible mechanisms that drive the dynamics between chronic poverty and ecosystem services: (1) poverty-environment trap; (2) ecosystem services as a natural insurance; (3) shared vulnerabilities; (4) institutional failure to manage the commons. These mechanisms are examined empirically using a case study of mangrove ecosystem services in rural coastal Tanzania\, where chronic poverty and mangrove degradation coexist.Â  \nLunch served for seminar attendees \n
