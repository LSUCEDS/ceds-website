SUMMARY:LSU College of the Coast & Environment – Lecture with Davin Wallace
DESCRIPTION:LSU College of the Coast & Environment Lecture Series will host Dr. Davin Wallace from the University of Southern Mississippi who will speak on “PALEOTEMPESTOLOGICAL HURRICANE RECONSTRUCTIONS FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO\, CARIBBEAN\, AND NORTH ATLANTIC: GLOBAL CLIMATE IMPLICATIONS” \nFriday\, December 2\, 2016\,  11:30 a.m. – 12:15 p.m. ( Lunch will be provided immediately following the lecture.)\nDalton J. Woods Auditorium in the LSU Energy\, Coast\, and Environment Building \nABSTRACT:  Given the relatively short historic and instrumental observations\, paleotempestology can extend these records and expand our understanding of hurricanes. This approach is particularly useful to quantify risk and hurricane response to past climatic and oceanographic variability. In an effort to add to the expanding number of sites across the planet\, we explore the potential of previously understudied environments capable of producing long-term hurricane records. We present several new Holocene paleotempestological records from the Gulf of Mexico\, Caribbean\, and North Atlantic margins. We discuss a multiproxy approach for many of the sites consisting of X-radiographs\, X-ray fluorescence\, micropaleontology\, grain size measurements\, and inverse sediment transport models in the context of Bayesian statistical age-depth relationships relying on short (annual) and long-term (millennia) radiometric dating techniques. By comparing these spatially and temporally varying records\, we discuss regional and basin-wide storm trends\, as well as local to global climatic implications. \n
