SUMMARY:LSU CCE Seminar: Dr. Sophie Warny
DESCRIPTION: \nDr. Sophie Warny\nDepartment of Geology & Geophysics\nLSU \nReconstructing past climate and environments from Antarctica to the GulfÂ Coast \nDalton J. Woods Auditorium\nLSU Energy\, Coast & Environment Building\nFebruary 2\, 2018\n11:30 a.m. \nWe will review the impact of ice-sheet contraction and expansion on our environment. We will first review a case study analyzing the impact of northern hemisphere ice-sheet melting on the Gulf Coast in the Holocene. Then\, we will shift focus to the Southern hemisphere and review the results of a series of Antarctic palynological studies that evaluated the type of vegetation changes that occurred in Antarctica in the Cenozoic to better constrain the timing and amplitude of these changes. Fossils of pollen and spores recovered from our sites provide a record of vegetation changes that occurred in each of these regions of Antarctica. The timing of these changes are evaluated against known driving factors such as atmospheric concentration in carbon dioxide\, plate tectonic activity (or lack of)\, precipitation\, and temperature (sea-surface and atmospheric) changes. \n
