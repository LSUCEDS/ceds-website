The office provides services from strategic development and research to public space design—working on and connecting different scales that reach from interiors to urban environments and from gardens to regional landscapes. An innovative combination of research and design is a key factor in Defacto’s work.  Among clients are project developers, housing corporations, national and international governments as well as private clients. Defacto works in close cooperation with other disciplines and experts in order to come to integral and feasible strategies and designs.</p>
