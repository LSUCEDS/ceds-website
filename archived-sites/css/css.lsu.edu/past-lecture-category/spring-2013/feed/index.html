<p><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/2013/05/kristina-hill-lecture/kristina-hill-picture-291x300/" rel="attachment wp-att-4243"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4243" title="Kristina-Hill-picture-291x300" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Kristina-Hill-picture-291x300.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>On May 10th  <em>Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture &amp; Environmental Planning, College of Environmental Design, UC Berkeley </em>Dr. Hill presented her recent explorations of the potential for urban shorelines to offer a meaningful spectacle of environmental change as an aesthetic experience. She has been testing ideas for sand meganourishment projects to create dynamic urban beaches, and for pier structures to include and reveal habitat stratification along changing shorelines. Examples will be used from Virginia Beach and San Francisco Bay. Hill received her PhD from Harvard and was previously on the faculties of MIT, UW-Seattle, and University of Virginia. She was honored as a Fellow of the Urban Design Institute in New York and conducted research in Stockholm, Sweden as a Fulbright Scholar. Her work addresses urban ecological dynamics in relation to the new challenges associated with climate change. Her book <em>Ecology and Design: Frameworks for Learning</em>was published by Island Press in 2002, and her current book project focuses on adapting urban waterfronts to climate change. Her work in urban design is currently focused on New Orleans, where she is a member of the Dutch-American engineering and design team collaborating with colleagues in The Netherlands to understand coastal sand transport and the potential for lower-cost, dynamic designs to help secure coastal communities as sea levels rise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Designing the Texas Coast</em></strong></p>
<p>On April 30, Thomas Colbert gave an overview of current Texas coastal design and planning responses to the challenges of severe weather events, climate change, and rapid growth. His interests include research into architecture and the modern city, especially the cultural and technological forces that shape the built environment and the dialogue between building and place. Current projects include single-family home designs and research into the impact of infrastructure on urban form, planning, and design for climate change, as well as coastal hurricane remediation. He holds a Diploma in architecture from Cambridge University and an A.B. from Princeton. Recent articles concerning research work and building reviews have been published in and are under development for Cite, The Architecture + Design Review of Houston, and Texas Architect.</p>

<p>Founding Principal, SvR Design Company Peg Staeheli spoke on April 12th on the move from pilot projects to Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) as well as leveraging the economic benefits of integrating GSI, thinking through the details to achieve performance-based solutions, and shifting from maintaining designs to designing for maintenance. She is a founding principal of the Seattle-based firm SvR Design Company, an integrated practice that blurs the lines between landscape architecture, civil engineering, and applied ecology. SvR is a national leader in the planning and design of green infrastructure systems. Staeheli has been active in facilitating the design industry shift to an integrated disciplines approach to planning, design, and maintenance. She has presented at national conferences on pedestrian mobility, accessible design, and green infrastructure systems. She is a registered landscape architect and LEED Accredited Professional.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Retrofitting for Resiliency</em></strong></p>
<p>Dr. Beatley presented strategies used by communities across the nation to reduce their ecological footprint and create socially equitable places in the context of increased environmental vulnerability and climate change. Topics included techniques for re-designing existing civic structures, modification of land use regulations, financial incentives to encourage sustainable development in and around coastal and flood-prone areas, and case studies of coastal communities that have successfully used these strategies while projecting economic growth. Dr. Beatley is Teresa Heinz Professor of Sustainable Communities in the Department of Urban and Environmental Planning at the University of Virginia. He is author or co-author of more than 15 books including Green Urbanism, Native to Nowhere, Ethical Land Use, and Biophilic Cities. He holds a PhD in city and regional planning from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>City of Water: Architecture, Infrastructure, and the Floods of Phnom Penh</em></strong></p>
<p>Shelby Doyle, a Fulbright Research Fellow based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, discussed her current research that documents the relationship between water, architecture, and infrastructure in the Cambodian capital as it rapidly urbanizes in a flood plain. She holds a Master of Architecture from the Harvard Graduate School of Design and Bachelor of Science in Architecture from the University of Virginia. She previously worked at Cook+Fox Architects in New York City where her projects included high end residential, children’s hospital visitor center, homeless shelter health clinic, and competitions and schematic design proposals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Stories About a Delta</p>
<p>Jane Wolff is an Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture at Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, and Design, University of Toronto</p>
<p>Jane Wolff’s lecture focuses on the complexity of translating technical information about landscape design and engineering across significant culture gaps between The Netherlands and New Orleans. Educated as a documentary filmmaker and landscape architect at Harvard University, Wolff is interested in the hybrid landscapes formed by interactions between natural process and cultural intervention. Her current research includes projects on the cultural landscape of San Francisco Bay and on Toronto’s landscape as infrastructure. The author of<em>Delta Primer: A Field Guide to the California Delta</em>, she is a partner in the Gutter to Gulf initiative, which provides information about urban infrastructure and ecology in New Orleans through its website,<a href="http://www.guttertogulf.com" target="_blank">www.guttertogulf.com</a>. She serves on the Design Review Board of Waterfront Toronto. Her work has been supported by 2 Fulbright scholarships and research grants from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Graham Foundation, Great Valley Center, LEF Foundation, Ohio State University, and University of Toronto. She previously served as assistant professor at Washington University and Ohio State University, and was Beatrix Farrand distinguished professor at UC-Berkeley.</p>

</strong>Senior Critic<br />
Department of Architecture<br />
Rhode Island School of Design</p>
<p>Enrique Martínez is a Senior Critic at the Department of Architecture, Rhode Island School of Design. He is a founding member of the Rhode Island Food Policy Council and serves in the Providence Zoning Board of Reviews.
