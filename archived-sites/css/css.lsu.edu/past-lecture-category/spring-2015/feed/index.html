As the founder and president of Biohabitats, Keith has built a multidisciplinary organization focused on regenerative design – the blurring of boundaries between conservation planning, ecological restoration and sustainable design. Using living-systems as the basis for all of its work, Biohabitats applies a whole-systems approach to all of its projects. Keith has applied his expertise to more than 600 projects throughout North America. His work has spanned the scale from site-specific ecosystem restoration projects involving wetland, river, woodland and coastal habitat restoration to regional watershed management and conservation planning, to the development of comprehensive sustainability programs for communities and campuses throughout the country. Keith is the Team Lead for Ecological Restoration under IUCN’s Commission on Ecosystem Management. Recently Keith served on the Board of Directors for the Wildlands Network and on the Board of Directors for the Society for Ecological Restoration, twice as its Chair. He is a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects and is a Professional Wetland Scientist. He holds a B.S. in Landscape Architecture from West Virginia University and an honorary degree from the Conway School of Design.</span></p>
