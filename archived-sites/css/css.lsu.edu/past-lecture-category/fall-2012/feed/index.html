				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>“Investing in Hazard Mitigation: Past Examples and Future Opportunities”</em></strong></p>
<p>This is the first in the LRAP series of webinars and accompanying workshops, <em>Planning for a Resilient Future</em>, that will address specific topics with regard to planning, financing and implementing local risk reduction efforts. (See entire series schedule at <em><a href="resiliency.lsu.edu">resiliency.lsu.edu</a></em>)</p>
<p>George Haddow is a Partner at Bullock &amp; Haddow, LLC and Principal Architect of <em>Project Impact: Building Disaster Resistant Communities</em>, a former FEMA national disaster mitigation initiative.</p>
<p>This webinar addresses how community public-private partnerships and planning for hazard mitigation can promote economic development.  George Haddow presents select communities from across the country that have experienced measurable economic growth after building partnerships to reduce flood risk. His experience with the FEMA program Project Impact, as well as significant community planning, outreach and mitigation efforts nationwide, are discussed to place Louisiana community planning efforts in a national context.</p>
<p>The full webinar can be viewed <a href="http://coadmediasite.lsu.edu/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=45801065556f415da6dff7766ac453ca1d">here </a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ulrike Heine’s research focuses on the design, detailing, simulation, and evaluation of a ZERO ENERGY HOUSE that can be adapted to various Southern climactic conditions using passive energy strategies and natural materials.</p>
<p>The Zero Energy House demonstrates how architectural design and planning can achieve a low-energy home from natural materials at an affordable cost. The homeowner can decide to add active energy-gaining technologies to bring the house to net-zero status, producing at least as much energy as it uses.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Ximing Cai Lecture</h2>
<p>Dr. Ximing Cai, Professor and the Ven Te Chow Faculty Scholar in Water Resources in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, spoke at the CSS lecture series Friday.</p>
<p>click <a href="http://coadmediasite.lsu.edu/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=9f887fe7170e431a927c92e90e2f90811d">here</a> to view the full lecture</p>
<p><strong><em>“Reservoir Reoperation to Balance Human and Ecological Water Requirements: Implications for Watershed Restoration”</em></strong></p>
<p>Historically, reservoirs were primarily designed to serve human societies by water supply, flood control, hydropower generation, recreation, etc.  Nowadays, environmental and ecological objectives have been called for change reservoir operation to meet such objectives, which however may jeopardize those original objectives.  How to balance between the new (ecological) and original (human) objectives rises as an issue for watershed restoration practices.  Traditionally, a minimum water release from a reservoir is set to satisfy the downstream ecosystem flow requirement. Recently, it is suggested to replace the concept of &#8216;minimum water release&#8217; with &#8216;natural flow regimes&#8217; for downstream ecosystems. In a recent study, based on the findings on the most ecologically relevant hydrologic indicators, we examined the practicalities of adding an ecological objective to the operation of Lake Shelbyville, a reservoir situated on the Kaskaskia River in east-central Illinois with its primary objective to reduce flood-induced agricultural damage. An ecological-hydrologic relationship between flow conditions and fish communities at the site was first identified using a fish community model, which links hydrological indicators with the fish diversity index through a data mining approach. A multi-objective optimization model was then developed to optimize the operation rules for two objectives: minimizing flood damage and maximizing fish diversity for the downstream ecosystem, using daily inflows. The results show that adding the ecological objective to Lake Shelbyville&#8217;s operation may not necessarily jeopardize the primary flooding control objective while improving the downstream fish habitats. Thus improving reservoir operation may save millions of dollars needed for facility re-construction to restore fish ecosystems. Reservoir re-operation can be one of the feasible options for watershed restoration. To make this option more efficient, closer collaboration of hydrologists and ecologists is still needed to provide solid scientific support; while stakeholders’ participation is critical to understand the opportunities and to deal with the trade-offs between human and natural objectives in integrated watershed management.</p>

Along with the  decades of experience he brings from the United States Geological  Survey, academia and as a world-class scientist whose recent research  has focused on energy and water resources, Dr. Groat spent many years  developing an acute understanding of the needs of our coastal areas in  Louisiana. Most recently, Groat has served as the director of the Center  for International Energy and Environmental Policy and associate  director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin,  where he has held the John A. and Katherine G. Jackson Chair in Energy  and Mineral Resources at the Jackson School of Geosciences. He served as  director of the U.S. Geological Survey under Presidents Bill Clinton  and George W. Bush. He has extensive experience as an educator and  government scientist, including time spent at Louisiana State University  and the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources.</p>
