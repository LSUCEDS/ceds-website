Catherine Seavitt Studio<br />
</strong><strong>Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture</strong><br />
<strong>City College of New York<br />
</strong>Prof. Seavitt will speak on <em>Structures of Coastal Resiliency: Jamaica Bay</em>. Her work focuses on design adaptation to sea level rise in urban coastal environments and explores novel landscape restoration practices given the dynamics of climate change. She co-authored the book <em>On the Water: Palisade Bay</em>, a climate adaptation proposal for the New York / New Jersey Upper Harbor. This study examines the use of “soft” infrastructural systems to mitigate the impact of storm surge and was the foundation of the 2010 exhibition <a href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1031" target="_blank"><em>Rising Currents</em></a> at the Museum of Modern Art. She is currently leading research at Jamaica Bay as part of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded grant <em>Structures of Coastal Resilience</em>. She earned her MArch from Princeton University.</p>
