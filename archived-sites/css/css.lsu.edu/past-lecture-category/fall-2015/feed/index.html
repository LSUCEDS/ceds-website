<p style="text-align: justify;">Sherwood &#8220;Woody&#8221; Gagliano founded Coastal Environments, Inc. after serving for 12 years on the faculty of the Coastal Studies Institute and the Departments of Geography and Marine Sciences at LSU. Dr. Gagliano served as management advisor and consultant to various owners of large, lowland properties in coastal Louisiana, and several federal and state agencies. He conducted fieldwork on coastal and riverine geology, physical processes, and archaeology along several coasts around the world. Dr. Gagliano is one of Louisiana’s foremost experts on deltaic, river and coastal processes, and is one of the principal authors of Louisiana’s Coast 2050 restoration plan. He continues to work with state and federal agencies on designs and plans for the implementation of large-scale coastal restoration measures. He uses his research and knowledge to fashion viable land use and renewable resource management approaches which are deeply embedded in Louisiana’s coastal management and restoration program.</p>
