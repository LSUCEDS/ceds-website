				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robin Keegan, Director of Resilient Baton Rouge, will be presenting at our Brown Bag lecture, scheduled for Tuesday before Thanksgiving, November 21, at noon. Robin will speak on “Disasters Are Coming! Now Is Not the Time To Reinvent the Wheel!”</p>
<p>Her presentation will be “a reflection on the role of the Louisiana Recovery Authority as a network to solve problems and the importance of building off of what we’ve learned throughout the years of recovering from disasters.”</p>
<p>Robin Keegan is a sought after expert in disaster recovery, pre-disaster planning and mitigation, economic development, housing, resilience and community building. Robin currently serves as the Director of Resilient Baton Rouge, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-supported project to increase behavioral health services and build resilience capacity for residents of the Baton Rouge region impacted by the Great Flood of 2016.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Robin returned home to New Orleans from New York City to serve in multiple roles at the Louisiana Recovery Authority (LRA) including Executive Director. Most recently, Robin was the Director of Community Planning and Resilience at GCR, Inc., a New Orleans-based professional and technology services firm. She also serves as an adjunct lecturer for Tulane University’s School of Architecture.  Robin holds a Master of Science in Urban Planning from Columbia University and a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies from Macalester College.</p>

<h2>Liz Williams</h2>
<h6 class="seo">Lousiana’s Coastal Community Resilience Director</h6>
<h6 class="seo"><strong>Liz Williams designs strategies to support communities influenced by land loss and relative sea-level rise across coastal Louisiana.</strong><span> </span>With a background and training in architectural design, landscape systems, and urban planning, Liz incorporates the complexities of the developed urban ecosystem to promote equitable opportunities in areas altered and affected by land change. Liz manages coastal grant-making areas with an advisory committee and relevant partners that work to help communities face a range of issues and challenges that range in scale from mega-regional networks and hydrologic basins to stormwater management and flood insurance.</h6>
<p>Risk mitigation and resilience-based programs require an awareness of and participation with these transitioning watersheds. In order to better provide opportunities, establish and cultivate partnerships, and advocate for informed and diverse public engagement, Liz supports fundraising initiatives and guides the common campaign and funding plan across Foundation for Louisiana’s Coastal Resiliency Leverage Fund.</p>
<p>Liz previously has worked as a Research Fellow and Affiliate with the Coastal Sustainability Studio at Louisiana State University. In this role she led and collaborated with cohorts of civil engineers, urban planners, coastal scientists, and landscape architects alongside economic, legal, and cultural advisors. Each project engaged a set of unique conditions within the coastal landscape and proposed developments through which residents and communities might advance and thrive in a future with evolving challenges.</p>
<p>In addition to early years of experience within traditional architecture practice, Liz has held a range of academic positions. She has taught within the School of Architecture at<span> </span><span class="caps">LSU</span>, the Department of Architecture and Landscape within the University of Greenwich in London, London College of Contemporary Art, and Birmingham City University in the UK.</p>
