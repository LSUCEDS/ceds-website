				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>&#8220;An Atlas of iPhone Landscapes&#8221;</strong> (click <a href="http://coadmediasite.lsu.edu/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=701f98c2cefd4c71a87a846a75e0d1631d">her</a>e to view)</p>
<p>“Before a democratic society can make sensible collective decisions about its future, it must first have accurate descriptions of its present.” To do his part, Holmes has undertaken a massive research project to catalogue the global landscapes created by the iPhone. His aim is not to pick apart the Apple tech in particular, but rather use it as a “particularly representative lens” of how immaterial technology physically shapes the planet. And in doing so, he goes back 2 billion years to the Proterozoic era, when zinc deposits were laid down that now are mined for the iPhone’s indium touchscreen. He takes us to Chinese mines and factories, recent New York Times fodder, Google server farms in Oregon, and cell towers in Spain. And he does it all using satellite photos to drive home the message.</p>
<p>Mammoth is an architectural research, design, and development cartel, currently directed by Rob Holmes and Stephen Becker.  Their interests include extinct megafauna, the production of urban space through the manipulation of infrastructure, landscape processes, and tactical architectural interventions aimed at forestalling the arrival of our inevitably dystopian future and/or ushering in a new era of global harmony.</p>
<p>Rob Holmes is a landscape architect with Michael Vergason Landscape Architects in Alexandria, Virginia, and recipient of the American Society of Landscape Architect’s Potomac Chapter Student Honor Award. He is co-founder of Mammoth, a research and design collaborative, which investigates the interface of infrastructures, logistics, landscape, and architectural possibilities in contemporary cities, and a founding member of the ExEx. His writing, research, and design work has been published in various magazines, journals, and books including Bracket, Urban Design Review, Landscape Architecture, GOOD, MONU, and Crit. His most recent public appearances were at the Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York City and MediaLab Prado in Madrid, Spain</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Arnold&#8217;s Lecture &#8220;Adaptation Science for Adaptation Action at the US Army Corps of Engineers&#8221; can be viewed<a href="http://coadmediasite.lsu.edu/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=92c8925dc1ca471f97a8f42f0a1c4c501d"> HERE</a>.</p>
<p>The motivation for climate change adaptation at the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is to ensure continued capacity to protect the enormous Federal investment in water-related resources, estimated in the 50 states to be US$2.5 trillion.  We’re doing this both by improving the resilience of our infrastructure and other water-related resources and by reducing the potential vulnerabilities of these resources to climate change effects.  USACE managers are now planning the climate adaptation strategies and policies to ensure the effective and efficient use of those resources on temporal scales ranging from short (hourly to seasonal to annual), through intermediate (2-10years) to long term (10-100 years of longer).  Our adaptation spatial scales, like the temporal ones, vary widely, too, from short reaches of headwaters streams to river systems the size of the Missouri and Mississippi.</p>
<p>We call our approach at USACE ‘decision scaling’ (after Brown, 2009).  It has these broad steps: 1- identify the questions and decisions facing water resource managers, 2-characterize the sensitivity of these decisions to climate change, 3-select and apply climate science and climate change information appropriate to the scale of those decisions, 4-test those decisions and select based on existing decision frameworks and weights, 5- apply decisions in action, 6-monitor for effects and residual change, 7- correct course where necessary.  This talk will present more details on our approach and give a few examples of how we’re implementing it now at USACE.</p>
<p>Jeff Arnold serves on national and international proposal and project review committees, is a regular reviewer for journals in the atmospheric sciences, and has more than 40 peer-reviewed publications. He holds a PhD in Environmental Sciences and Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>He currently manages projects in IWR&#8217;s Sustainable Solutions project delivery team, such as computing parts of the USACE greenhouse gas footprint, as well as other climate change mitigation and adaptation work. He also supports USACE Headquarters, the OASA (CW), Corps field offices, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Air Quality Research subcommittee of the Council on Environment and Natural Resources Research Committee on questions about Corps climate mitigation and adaptation goals, work and policy development.</p>
<p>Jeff went to IWR and the Corps from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) where he was the senior scientist for atmospheric chemistry and physics and led the assessments of global climate change-air quality interactions in the National Center for Environmental Assessment, a unit of EPA&#8217;s Office of Research and Development in Research, Triangle Park, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Before going to EPA, Jeff had been a senior scientist and project manager in National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#8217;s (NOAA) Air Resources Laboratory, working for 10 years in Seattle, Washington and at field experiment sites around the U.S., Europe and China. He worked for more than 15 years on problems in atmospheric chemistry and physics under conditions of future change, particularly ones related to nitrogen and its effects on aquatic systems. In that time, he was principal investigator for a number of U.S. and international ground- and aircraft-based field campaigns and large-scale numerical modeling experiments, work for which he&#8217;s received national awards from EPA and NOAA.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Between Land and Water</strong><em> (click <a href="http://coadmediasite.lsu.edu/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=410b1073869f441b8c1771b8e1848a511d">here</a> for lecture)</em></p>
<p>Historically, building existed as a natural response to the way people lived within a specific landscape. As technology and modern culture surge forward we are losing a sense of the places we inhabit and must look critically at how we occupy them and use their resources. As a complex system of rivers, swamps, flora and fauna, tourism, industry and important infrastructure, Southeastern Louisiana’s vitality is contingent upon the interaction of these interdependent parts &#8211; which include humans. By taking a careful, critical approach to this place, we can set up a framework in Southeastern Louisiana for making sustainable, responsive architecture, design, planning, and engineering. Between Land and Water aims to employ such a framework and attempts to establish a paradigm for occupying the boundary between land and water in Louisiana, promoting an understanding of our unique relationship to this boundary and facilitating ways to live with it.</p>
<p>William J. Doran, IV was born and raised in Southeastern Louisiana and has been a Professional-in-Residence in the School of Architecture at LSU for the last two years. He has a 5-year Professional Degree in Architecture from Louisiana State University and a Master of Architecture in Design Build from the University of Kansas. His collaborative work at The University of Kansas recently won a 2011 Residential Architect Design Award. The project, Prescott passive House, is both LEED Platinum and Passive House Certified. William has also worked in architectural design in both Baton Rouge and Chicago. Projects range from small-scale residential work to multi-million dollar planning and commercial projects in the States and overseas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our Spring 2012 Lecture Series kicked off last Thursday with Phil Berke.  Dr. Berke is Professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning. He is Deputy Director of the Institute for the Environment (IE), Director of the Center for Sustainable Community Design of IE, and Adjunct Professor in the Curriculum of Ecology at the University of North Carolina. He is currently a Collaborative Research Scholar of the International Global Change Institute in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The central focus of his research is to develop a deeper understanding of the connections between human settlements and the natural environment. His research seeks to explore the causes of land use decisions and their consequences on the environmental, social, and economic systems of human settlements. His ultimate goal is to seek solutions to complex urban development problems that enhance the transition to sustainable communities.</p>
<p>His lecture can be viewed <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a href="http://coadmediasite.lsu.edu/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=6f5d8a37aa0644a384c6e25c5d79e2861d"><span style="color: #ff6600;">here.</span></a></span></p>
