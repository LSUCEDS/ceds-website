				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 15-17, 2017, the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) hosted the Louisiana Community Resilience Institute (LCRI) Recovery and Resiliency Workshop in Alexandria, Louisiana, on behalf of five elected officials from Louisiana communities flooded during the spring of 2016.  In preparation for the event, CSS worked directly with each official to decide on a single local community challenge and possible project to bring to the workshop for analysis and feedback from peers and subject matter experts. Participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayor Wendy O’Quin Perrette of Bogalusa</li>
<li>Mayor Roland Smith of Campti</li>
<li>Mayor Jamie Mayo of Monroe</li>
<li>Natchitoches Parish President Rick Nowlin</li>
<li>Mayor Dave Norris of West Monroe</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7190" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-601x400.jpg 601w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-1277x850.jpg 1277w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3.jpg 1429w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>During the workshop, elected officials were paired with six nationally-renowned planning, urban design, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals to work one-on-one and in the peer group setting on potential community projects.  Following the workshop, mayors returned home better equipped for real world prob­lem-solving, possessing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of community design and planning processes</li>
<li>Substantially increased confidence in their ability to tackle complex issues</li>
<li>A support network of experienced political peers</li>
<li>Access to subject matter experts and new community resilience resources</li>
<li>A repertoire of ideas and and/or well-defined solutions tailored specif­ically to community challenges</li>
<li>Funding and partnership ideas to help solve community problems</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to the workshop, CSS research faculty member Dr. Traci Birch met with each mayor onsite to assist with the development of a case study that represented a significant challenge within each community.  CSS staff and students also developed a resource manual for the mayors, containing researched information and infographics related to planning and resilience relevant to each community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Institute was structured in a way to maximize interaction, networking, brainstorming, and discussion among the mayors, subject matter experts, and other key contacts. During the workshop each mayor presented a particular challenge their community currently faces, followed by a group discussion to generate creative strategies to address these challenges and improve community development, resilience, and quality-of-life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-6554 aligncenter" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DSC_0019-620x412.jpg" alt="DSC_0019" width="485" height="322" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Presentations from a panel of invited experts during the workshop introduced participating mayors to tools, technologies, and best practices. The panel included some of the nation’s top experts in applied ecology, land conservation, sustainable design, green real estate development, disaster recovery, pre-disaster planning and mitigation, economic development, urban resilience and sustainable infrastructure planning, and coastal management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-6557 aligncenter" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DSC_0006-620x412.jpg" alt="DSC_0006" width="480" height="319" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the workshop, a reception hosted at the LSU President&#8217;s House provided the mayors with the opportunity to network with relevant contacts in state and federal government, coastal research and community outreach, and non-profit organizations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/2016/04/first-annual-louisiana-community-resilience-institute/dsc_0011/" rel="attachment wp-att-6520"><img class="wp-image-6520 aligncenter" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DSC_0011.jpg" alt="DSC_0011" width="484" height="321" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By participating in the LA Community Resiliency Institute, the six mayors gained knowledge that will allow them to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) better understand the community design and planning process</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) have increased confidence in their ability to tackle complex issues, further strengthened by a support network of peer leaders, and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3) a repertoire of ideas and perhaps even well-defined solutions tailored specifically to their community&#8217;s challenges.</p>
<p>The CSS and participating subject matter experts plan to continue working with the mayors to coordinate strategic partnerships, provide additional research through project support or design studios, and/or seek financial support through grants funding or gifts.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, one of two urban long-term ecological research (LTER) projects funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, we are using “the watershed approach” to integrate ecological, physical and social sciences.  Watersheds are a natural (and well-used) physical unit for bio-geo-chemical research and can also function as a focus for human-environment interactions, i.e. bio-geo-socio-chemistry.  Suburban watershed input/output budgets for nitrogen (N) have shown surprisingly high retention which has led to detailed analysis of sources and sinks in these watersheds.  Riparian zones, thought to be an important sink for N in many watersheds, have turned out be N sources in urban watersheds due to hydrologic changes that disconnect streams from their surrounding landscape.  Geomorphic stream restoration designed to reverse structural degradation caused by urban runoff can increase in-stream retention by creating features with high denitrification potential. Considering the “human element” in these biogeochemical source and sink processes is critical to improving the environmental performance of urban and suburban ecosystems.  Including human goals in stream restoration can help to establish connections between people and streams, which can lead to improvements in water quality as people become monitors and advocates for stream ecosystem integrity.  Creating positive feedbacks between ecological restoration and human preferences can be key for achieving specific biogeosociochemical goals in urban and suburban watersheds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Peter M. Groffman </strong>is a Professor at the City University of New York Advanced Science Research Center and Brooklyn College, with research interests in ecosystem, soil, landscape and microbial ecology, with a focus on carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Groffman is chair of the Executive Board of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network Science Council and a participant in LTER projects in Baltimore (urban) and New Hampshire (northern hardwood forests).  Specific recent research efforts include studies of nitrogen dynamics in urban watersheds, lawns, riparian zones and forests, winter climate change effects on nutrient cycling in forests, calcium/nitrogen/carbon interactions in forests, and the effects of exotic earthworm invasion on soil nitrogen and carbon cycling. Groffman was a Convening Lead Author for the 2013 U.S. National Climate Assessment Chapter on Ecosystems, Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and a lead author for the Second (Wetlands) and Third (North America) Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHANGING COURSE NEWS RELEASE</p>
<p><strong>Global Design Competition Presents 100-Year Visions for Restoring and Sustaining Louisiana’s Eroding Coast</strong></p>
<p><em>Designs Offer Solutions to Rebuild Mississippi River Delta, Protect Communities and Industries</em></p>
<p>(NEW ORLEANS – August 20, 2015) The international <a href="http://changingcourse.us/">Changing Course</a> design competition today announced its winning teams and the teams’ 100-year visions for restoring and sustaining the Mississippi River Delta for the people and industries that call it home. The winning teams – comprised of some of the world’s top engineers, coastal scientists, planners and designers – are <a href="http://www.deltaforall.com">Baird and Associates</a>, <a href="http://www.moffattnichol.com/">Moffatt and Nichol<strong> &#8211; </strong></a><a href="http://west8.com/" target="_blank">West 8</a><a href="http://www.moffattnichol.com/"> &#8211;</a><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">LSU-CSS team</a>, and <a href="http://www.h3studio.com/misi-ziibi-1/">Studio Misi-Ziibi</a>.</p>
<p>“We challenged the world’s top experts to find the most innovative ways to make sure that New Orleans and southeast Louisiana aren’t held hostage to worsening storms, rising seas and a disappearing delta,” said Steve Cochran, Associate Vice President of Ecosystems at <a href="http://www.edf.org/">Environmental Defense Fund</a> and a member of the Changing Course Leadership Team. “We hope the winning ideas will help citizens, communities, industries and governments engage in real conversations about what it’s going to take to make this important region more resilient and prosperous.”</p>
<p>The winning teams’ designs are based on a 100-year planning horizon and focus on maximizing the Mississippi River’s natural and sustainable land-building potential while taking into the account of needs of navigation and other industries, flood control and sustainable community development – a challenge raised by the state of Louisiana’s master planning process.</p>
<p>“Because of the quality of the work, the State has committed to bringing the technical work from Changing Course into its process of analyzing the management scheme for the Lower Mississippi River, said Kyle Graham, Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Executive Director.  “We look forward to working with the teams.”</p>
<p>Over the last century, nearly 1,900 square miles of Louisiana’s coastal wetlands have vanished. Every hour, a football field-sized swath of land drowns in the Gulf’s advancing tides. At this rate, by 2100, Louisiana’s protective coast will be gone. The solutions proposed by the winning teams focus primarily on the Mississippi River south of New Orleans.</p>
<p>While each of the winning teams offered a different vision, all three identified three major themes as critical to sustaining the Mississippi River Delta today and into the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear focus on a sustainable delta through using the natural forces of the Mississippi River;</li>
<li>Maximum integration of navigation, flood control and restoration, including consideration of ideas for a better and more sustainable navigation channel;</li>
<li> Consideration of a gradual transition of industry and communities into more protected and resilient communities, over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As sea levels rise, communities around the world, particularly in major river deltas, need novel approaches to find sustainable solutions.  Changing Course is a great example of how world class expertise can be combined with local wisdom to produce ideas that work.”  said Dr. Don Boesch Changing Course leadership team member and Professor of Marine Science and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.</p>
