				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>We invite you to submit an <strong>AGU abstract</strong> to our session on <strong>Coastal Sustainability and Resilience</strong>. This session is a follow-up to very successful sessions (two oral and one poster session totaling 32 presentations) on coastal sustainability that were offered in New Orleans last year.</p>
<p>With this year&#8217;s meeting in Washington DC, we expect to have a very lively and policy-relevant discussion on coastal sustainability with an emphasis on creating convergence that will encourage collaborative new ways of understanding and governing our shifting coastlines. We look forward to new insights and the emergent challenges/opportunities identified in the last year.</p>
<p>The deadline to submit an abstract is <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/51428" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/prelim.cgi/Session/51428"><strong>August 1, 2018.</strong></a></p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you in DC!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Session ID#: </strong>51428<br />
<strong>Session Title: </strong><strong>GC028 </strong>Creating Convergence among Academic, State, Federal, and NGO Initiatives to Enhance Sustainability and Resilience of Coastal Systems</p>
<p><strong>Session Description:<br />
</strong>Sustainable, resilient coastal environments require scientific advancements from interconnected studies covering a range of disciplines to effectively evaluate reciprocal feedbacks between coupled natural and human processes. For example, impacts of climate change prompt humans to alter the coastal land-margin which has implications for ecological systems as well as socioeconomic development, policy-making, and management of natural resources on multiple scales. A major goal of institutions worldwide (e.g., academia, state, federal, and NGO) is to produce transdisciplinary research outcomes that will inform society about sustainability practices and influence governance and decision making. This session integrates coastal systems studies that advance fields related to natural and social interactions with the broad aim of better understanding, implementing, and achieving convergence among the various coastal research communities. We invite presentations that address topics across the full spectrum of coastal sustainability and resilience, and encourage submissions from the engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences disciplines.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW ORLEANS — Accumulating sediment within the lower Mississippi River could, when coupled with a major flood, cause the river to abandon its current course, potentially ruining the drinking water source for roughly 1.5 million people, according to new research presented here today.</p>
<p>The Mississippi River is an alluvial river, meaning its course is shaped by sediment and floods, and its floor is composed of loose, moving sands and soils. Because of these qualities, the river naturally changes course every 1,000 to 1,500 years. The Old River Control Structure, a 54-year-old floodgate system, manages the flow of the Mississippi into the Atchafalaya River, which runs parallel to and west of the Mississippi. This system prevents the Mississippi from flooding and changing its course.</p>
