				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 15-17, 2017, the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) hosted the Louisiana Community Resilience Institute (LCRI) Recovery and Resiliency Workshop in Alexandria, Louisiana, on behalf of five elected officials from Louisiana communities flooded during the spring of 2016.  In preparation for the event, CSS worked directly with each official to decide on a single local community challenge and possible project to bring to the workshop for analysis and feedback from peers and subject matter experts. Participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayor Wendy O’Quin Perrette of Bogalusa</li>
<li>Mayor Roland Smith of Campti</li>
<li>Mayor Jamie Mayo of Monroe</li>
<li>Natchitoches Parish President Rick Nowlin</li>
<li>Mayor Dave Norris of West Monroe</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7190" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-601x400.jpg 601w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-1277x850.jpg 1277w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3.jpg 1429w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>During the workshop, elected officials were paired with six nationally-renowned planning, urban design, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals to work one-on-one and in the peer group setting on potential community projects.  Following the workshop, mayors returned home better equipped for real world prob­lem-solving, possessing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of community design and planning processes</li>
<li>Substantially increased confidence in their ability to tackle complex issues</li>
<li>A support network of experienced political peers</li>
<li>Access to subject matter experts and new community resilience resources</li>
<li>A repertoire of ideas and and/or well-defined solutions tailored specif­ically to community challenges</li>
<li>Funding and partnership ideas to help solve community problems</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/2016/04/first-annual-louisiana-community-resilience-institute/dsc_0007-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-6521"><img class="alignleft wp-image-6521" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DSC_0007-1.jpg" alt="DSC_0007" width="204" height="307" /></a>In partnership with Louisiana Sea Grant and the Kresge foundation, the Coastal Sustainability Studio recently hosted the first Louisiana Community Resilience Institute on April 14-15, 2016 at LSU.  The Institute brought together six mayors from Louisiana, and six nationally-renowned planning, urban design, coastal science, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals. The goal of the one-and-a-half day workshop was to offer mayors facing coastal problems within their communities a better understanding of the role of planning, design and hazard mitigation to enhance resilience within their respective communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to the workshop, CSS research faculty member Dr. Traci Birch met with each mayor onsite to assist with the development of a case study that represented a significant challenge within each community.  CSS staff and students also developed a resource manual for the mayors, containing researched information and infographics related to planning and resilience relevant to each community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Institute was structured in a way to maximize interaction, networking, brainstorming, and discussion among the mayors, subject matter experts, and other key contacts. During the workshop each mayor presented a particular challenge their community currently faces, followed by a group discussion to generate creative strategies to address these challenges and improve community development, resilience, and quality-of-life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class=" wp-image-6554 aligncenter" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DSC_0019-620x412.jpg" alt="DSC_0019" width="485" height="322" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Presentations from a panel of invited experts during the workshop introduced participating mayors to tools, technologies, and best practices. The panel included some of the nation’s top experts in applied ecology, land conservation, sustainable design, green real estate development, disaster recovery, pre-disaster planning and mitigation, economic development, urban resilience and sustainable infrastructure planning, and coastal management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="wp-image-6557 aligncenter" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DSC_0006-620x412.jpg" alt="DSC_0006" width="480" height="319" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the workshop, a reception hosted at the LSU President&#8217;s House provided the mayors with the opportunity to network with relevant contacts in state and federal government, coastal research and community outreach, and non-profit organizations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/2016/04/first-annual-louisiana-community-resilience-institute/dsc_0011/" rel="attachment wp-att-6520"><img class="wp-image-6520 aligncenter" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DSC_0011.jpg" alt="DSC_0011" width="484" height="321" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By participating in the LA Community Resiliency Institute, the six mayors gained knowledge that will allow them to:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) better understand the community design and planning process</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) have increased confidence in their ability to tackle complex issues, further strengthened by a support network of peer leaders, and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3) a repertoire of ideas and perhaps even well-defined solutions tailored specifically to their community&#8217;s challenges.</p>
<p>The CSS and participating subject matter experts plan to continue working with the mayors to coordinate strategic partnerships, provide additional research through project support or design studios, and/or seek financial support through grants funding or gifts.</p>

<strong>Thursday, Jan 28       Noon-1:00pm       Design Building 215</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, one of two urban long-term ecological research (LTER) projects funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, we are using “the watershed approach” to integrate ecological, physical and social sciences.  Watersheds are a natural (and well-used) physical unit for bio-geo-chemical research and can also function as a focus for human-environment interactions, i.e. bio-geo-socio-chemistry.  Suburban watershed input/output budgets for nitrogen (N) have shown surprisingly high retention which has led to detailed analysis of sources and sinks in these watersheds.  Riparian zones, thought to be an important sink for N in many watersheds, have turned out be N sources in urban watersheds due to hydrologic changes that disconnect streams from their surrounding landscape.  Geomorphic stream restoration designed to reverse structural degradation caused by urban runoff can increase in-stream retention by creating features with high denitrification potential. Considering the “human element” in these biogeochemical source and sink processes is critical to improving the environmental performance of urban and suburban ecosystems.  Including human goals in stream restoration can help to establish connections between people and streams, which can lead to improvements in water quality as people become monitors and advocates for stream ecosystem integrity.  Creating positive feedbacks between ecological restoration and human preferences can be key for achieving specific biogeosociochemical goals in urban and suburban watersheds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Peter M. Groffman </strong>is a Professor at the City University of New York Advanced Science Research Center and Brooklyn College, with research interests in ecosystem, soil, landscape and microbial ecology, with a focus on carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Groffman is chair of the Executive Board of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network Science Council and a participant in LTER projects in Baltimore (urban) and New Hampshire (northern hardwood forests).  Specific recent research efforts include studies of nitrogen dynamics in urban watersheds, lawns, riparian zones and forests, winter climate change effects on nutrient cycling in forests, calcium/nitrogen/carbon interactions in forests, and the effects of exotic earthworm invasion on soil nitrogen and carbon cycling. Groffman was a Convening Lead Author for the 2013 U.S. National Climate Assessment Chapter on Ecosystems, Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services and a lead author for the Second (Wetlands) and Third (North America) Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>

In the face of tremendous environmental challenges ranging from climate change adaptation, large-scale environmental restoration, and storm protection; trans-disciplinary efforts, like the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio have emerged to develop and implement solutions where single discipline solutions have fallen short. A growing awareness of social factors and the design of the built environment are beginning to impact the “protection and restoration” efforts in Louisiana and across the US. Effective integration of design thinking along-side scientific research and engineering is increasingly urgent. This presentation argues that designers engaged in this movement as it continues to develop will help to grow design research and add value to our practice as we grapple with increased risk to coastal settlement.</p>

<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #222222;"><em><strong>Living on the Edge: Protecting and Restoring Coastal Habitats</strong></em> </span></span></p>
<p>More than a third of the world&#8217;s population lives in coastal zones, which comprise just 4% of the Earth&#8217;s total land area. Coastal human population densities are nearly 3 times that of inland areas, and they are increasing exponentially. The resulting loss of estuarine and coastal ecosystems are impacting coastal communities in two ways: they are losing important recreational and livelihoods, and they are more at risk at coastal hazards, such as storm surges, coastal erosion and salt-water intrusion. Coastal habitat restoration and protection are expensive, and involve important tradeoffs, but they are important considerations in any long-term coastal management plan. Drawing on the 2012 Louisiana Master Plan and other case study examples from around the world, this public lecture discusses some of the key issues involved, and explains why coastal habitat protection and restoration not only are environmentally important but also make economic sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tuesday <strong>April 14</strong>      3:30 pm<br />
Reception to follow at 4:30<span style="color: #222222;"><br />
<em><strong>Valuing the Storm Protection Service of Estuarine and Coastal Ecosystems</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;"> Recent concern over the loss of estuarine and coastal ecosystems (ECEs) often focuses on an important service provided by these ecosystems, their role in protecting coastal communities from storms that damage property and cause deaths and injury. This talk reviews recent developments and improvements in the use of valuation methods to estimate these protection benefits. Recent case study valuations of coastal wetland protection and restoration in Louisiana will be reviewed. One promising approach is the expected damage function (EDF) method, which requires modelling the production of this protection service of ECEs and estimating its value in terms of reducing the expected damages or deaths avoided by coastal communities. This talk illustrates the EDF approach to valuing the storm protection service of ECEs, using the example of mangroves in Thailand to compare and contrast the EDF with the replacement cost approach to estimating the protective value of ECEs. In addition, the example of marshes in the US Gulf Coast is employed to show how the EDF approach can be combined with hydrodynamic analysis of simulated hurricane storm surges to determine the economic value of expected property damages reduced through the presence of marsh wetlands and their vegetation along a storm surge path.<br />
<br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">These lectures are sponsored by the LSU Coastal Studies Institute and LSU School of Graduate Studies.
