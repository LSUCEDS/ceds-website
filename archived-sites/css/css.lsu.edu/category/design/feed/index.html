				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 15-17, 2017, the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) hosted the Louisiana Community Resilience Institute (LCRI) Recovery and Resiliency Workshop in Alexandria, Louisiana, on behalf of five elected officials from Louisiana communities flooded during the spring of 2016.  In preparation for the event, CSS worked directly with each official to decide on a single local community challenge and possible project to bring to the workshop for analysis and feedback from peers and subject matter experts. Participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayor Wendy O’Quin Perrette of Bogalusa</li>
<li>Mayor Roland Smith of Campti</li>
<li>Mayor Jamie Mayo of Monroe</li>
<li>Natchitoches Parish President Rick Nowlin</li>
<li>Mayor Dave Norris of West Monroe</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7190" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-601x400.jpg 601w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-1277x850.jpg 1277w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3.jpg 1429w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>During the workshop, elected officials were paired with six nationally-renowned planning, urban design, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals to work one-on-one and in the peer group setting on potential community projects.  Following the workshop, mayors returned home better equipped for real world prob­lem-solving, possessing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of community design and planning processes</li>
<li>Substantially increased confidence in their ability to tackle complex issues</li>
<li>A support network of experienced political peers</li>
<li>Access to subject matter experts and new community resilience resources</li>
<li>A repertoire of ideas and and/or well-defined solutions tailored specif­ically to community challenges</li>
<li>Funding and partnership ideas to help solve community problems</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6212" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Boards1larger1-1000x333.jpg" alt="Boards1larger" width="1000" height="333" /> The CSS received a Special Mention in the “Constructed Ecology” category for its submission “Constructing Dynamism: A Tale of Two Basins” to the <a href="http://www.d3space.org/competitions/">2015 d3 Natural Systems competition</a>.  The competition entry was created by a team of interns and CSS research fellows as a part of the <a href="http://css.lsu.edu/?p=5876">2015 CSS Summer Internship</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Constructing Dynamism: A Tale of Two Basins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CSS team created a future design for coastal Louisiana, which is currently experiencing widespread wetland loss due to rising sea levels and a lack of riverine sediment supply (which are now shunted offshore resulting from the construction of river levees).  The team tackled the issue of redesigning Louisiana’s disappearing coast, based on two important premises they set forth:  1) ecosystem design should be done at the scale of hydrologic basins, and 2) riverine resources that have the potential to build new land (via river diversions) are limited.  This led to a design whereby one basin – Barataria – becomes increasingly fresh with wetlands fed by alluvial sediments from the Mississippi River, and the second basin – Terrebonne – becomes increasingly saline and migrates inland.  Divergent engineering and design strategies were explored in the two basins to support human infrastructure, ecological systems, and systems restoration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Project Thesis:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructures become ecological participants through networked hydrologic basin management. Inclusive of needs required for the productivity of adjacent social, economic, and ecological systems, <img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-6169 alignright" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/072415_InfrastructurePerspective-150x150.jpg" alt="&lt;pdf995:Z:Projects1506_D3Competition�3_Visual GraphicsPerspe" width="150" height="150" />Constructing Dynamism retrofits the existing HWY 90/future I-49 corridor as a multipurpose, cross-delta artery. Optimizing the distribution of limited coastal resources such as freshwater, sediment, and financial capital, this project assumes that basins will increasingly vary in salinity, encompassing fresh, brackish, and saline conditions. For the purposes of potential future scenario visualization, this project engages increasing freshwater and sediment within the Barataria Basin as well as an increasingly saline ecology throughout Terrebonne Basin. Producing a more flexible, diverse, and adaptive coastal region, design interventions are required to become participatory actuators within these hydrological conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently spanning much of the hydrologic system and a part of the Southeast Louisiana infrastructural network, HWY 90 is retrofitted and redesigned in order to act as a transportation connector between basins, as well as a facilitator of economic and ecological vitality. Within a condition of increasing salinity, the foundation of the structure engages with increased tidal flux and rising sea levels. In the adjacent and increasingly freshwater environment, the structural intervals facilitate flows and eddies in order to encourage sediment deposition. Multipurpose above ground and water planes, the rail and road connectors transport commuter populations to industry and settlement nodes while facilitating the transfer of resources above vulnerable territories. Specifically engaged relative to a transforming salinity gradient, the design interventions participate at multiple scales and are enabled by planning and operation strategies that incorporate watershed resources and distribution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHANGING COURSE NEWS RELEASE</p>
<p><strong>Global Design Competition Presents 100-Year Visions for Restoring and Sustaining Louisiana’s Eroding Coast</strong></p>
<p><em>Designs Offer Solutions to Rebuild Mississippi River Delta, Protect Communities and Industries</em></p>
<p>(NEW ORLEANS – August 20, 2015) The international <a href="http://changingcourse.us/">Changing Course</a> design competition today announced its winning teams and the teams’ 100-year visions for restoring and sustaining the Mississippi River Delta for the people and industries that call it home. The winning teams – comprised of some of the world’s top engineers, coastal scientists, planners and designers – are <a href="http://www.deltaforall.com">Baird and Associates</a>, <a href="http://www.moffattnichol.com/">Moffatt and Nichol<strong> &#8211; </strong></a><a href="http://west8.com/" target="_blank">West 8</a><a href="http://www.moffattnichol.com/"> &#8211;</a><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">LSU-CSS team</a>, and <a href="http://www.h3studio.com/misi-ziibi-1/">Studio Misi-Ziibi</a>.</p>
<p>“We challenged the world’s top experts to find the most innovative ways to make sure that New Orleans and southeast Louisiana aren’t held hostage to worsening storms, rising seas and a disappearing delta,” said Steve Cochran, Associate Vice President of Ecosystems at <a href="http://www.edf.org/">Environmental Defense Fund</a> and a member of the Changing Course Leadership Team. “We hope the winning ideas will help citizens, communities, industries and governments engage in real conversations about what it’s going to take to make this important region more resilient and prosperous.”</p>
<p>The winning teams’ designs are based on a 100-year planning horizon and focus on maximizing the Mississippi River’s natural and sustainable land-building potential while taking into the account of needs of navigation and other industries, flood control and sustainable community development – a challenge raised by the state of Louisiana’s master planning process.</p>
<p>“Because of the quality of the work, the State has committed to bringing the technical work from Changing Course into its process of analyzing the management scheme for the Lower Mississippi River, said Kyle Graham, Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Executive Director.  “We look forward to working with the teams.”</p>
<p>Over the last century, nearly 1,900 square miles of Louisiana’s coastal wetlands have vanished. Every hour, a football field-sized swath of land drowns in the Gulf’s advancing tides. At this rate, by 2100, Louisiana’s protective coast will be gone. The solutions proposed by the winning teams focus primarily on the Mississippi River south of New Orleans.</p>
<p>While each of the winning teams offered a different vision, all three identified three major themes as critical to sustaining the Mississippi River Delta today and into the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear focus on a sustainable delta through using the natural forces of the Mississippi River;</li>
<li>Maximum integration of navigation, flood control and restoration, including consideration of ideas for a better and more sustainable navigation channel;</li>
<li> Consideration of a gradual transition of industry and communities into more protected and resilient communities, over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As sea levels rise, communities around the world, particularly in major river deltas, need novel approaches to find sustainable solutions.  Changing Course is a great example of how world class expertise can be combined with local wisdom to produce ideas that work.”  said Dr. Don Boesch Changing Course leadership team member and Professor of Marine Science and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Constructing Dynamism: A Tale of Two Basins</strong><br />
The CSS team created a future design for coastal Louisiana, which is currently experiencing widespread wetland loss due to rising sea levels and a lack of riverine sediment supply (which are now shunted offshore resulting from the construction of river levees).  The team tackled the issue of redesigning Louisiana&#8217;s disappearing coast, based on two important premises they set forth:  1) ecosystem design should be done at the scale of hydrologic basins, and 2) riverine resources that have the potential to build new land (via river diversions)  are limited.  This led to a design whereby one basin &#8211; Barataria &#8211; becomes increasingly fresh with wetlands fed by alluvial sediments from the Mississippi River, and the second basin &#8211; Terrebonne &#8211; becomes increasingly saline and migrates inland.  Divergent engineering and design strategies were explored in the two basins to support human infrastructure, ecological systems, and systems restoration.</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Project Thesis:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructures become ecological participants through networked hydrologic basin management. Inclusive of needs required for the productivity of adjacent social, economic, and ecological systems, Constructing Dynamism retrofits the existing HWY 90/future I-49 corridor as a multipurpose, cross-delta artery. Optimizing the distribution of limited coastal resources such as freshwater, sediment, and financial capital, this project assumes that basins will increasingly vary in salinity, encompassing fresh, brackish, and saline conditions. For the purposes of potential future scenario visualization, this project engages increasing freshwater and sediment within the Barataria Basin as well as an increasingly saline ecology throughout Terrebonne Basin. Producing a more flexible, diverse, and adaptive coastal region, design interventions are required to become participatory actuators within these hydrological conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently spanning much of the hydrologic system and a part of the Southeast Louisiana infrastructural network, HWY 90 is retrofitted and redesigned in order to act as a transportation connector between basins, as well as a facilitator of economic and ecological vitality. Within a condition of increasing salinity, the foundation of the structure engages with increased tidal flux and rising sea levels. In the adjacent and increasingly freshwater environment, the structural intervals facilitate flows and eddies in order to encourage sediment deposition. Multipurpose above ground and water planes, the rail and road connectors transport commuter populations to industry and settlement nodes while facilitating the transfer of resources above vulnerable territories. Specifically engaged relative to a transforming salinity gradient, the design interventions participate at multiple scales and are enabled by planning and operation strategies that incorporate watershed resources and distribution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Waiting officially begins for <a href="http://css.lsu.edu/">LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio</a> and other organizations participating in a rigorous 18-month <em><a href="http://changingcourse.us/">Changing Course</a></em>  design competition which called for “bold thinking and focused action” to reimagine a more sustainable Lower Mississippi River Delta. CSS was an important contributor to one of three teams delivering final presentations at the unique competition held February 24-26, 2015, in New Orleans.</p>
<p>The independent design initiative—led by leaders in Louisiana’s civic, industry, and academic communities along with national experts in coastal resiliency, engineering, and design—hopes to contribute additional innovation, competition, and private sector engagement to inform Louisiana’s <a href="http://coastal.la.gov/a-common-vision/2017-master-plan-update/">next Coastal Master Plan slated for 2017</a>. The <a href="http://changingcourse.us/about-us/leadership-team/"><em>Changing Course</em> leadership group</a> served as the “client” throughout the process.</p>
<p>Competition was challenging.  Twenty-one teams responded to an initial Request for Qualifications (RFQ) released September 2013.   The first round of competitors included experts from top engineering firms in the world, oyster specialists, landscape architects, navigation experts, and much more. A Request for Proposal (RFP) was released January 2014 to eight teams, inviting them for two days of direct engagement with regional and local experts in areas such as communities and culture, shipping industry, fisheries, and sediment. In March 2014, <a href="http://changingcourse.us/">three teams were selected</a> to move forward in the competition, with final team presentations taking place a year later.</p>
<p><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/">CSS</a> served on the <a href="http://www.moffattnichol.com/">Moffatt &amp; Nichol</a> Team, which included <a href="http://www.deltares.nl/en">Deltares,</a> <a href="http://mitags-pmi.org/">Maritime Institute of Technology and Graduate Studies</a>, <a href="http://www.rand.org/">RAND Corporation</a>, <a href="http://www.uno.edu/pontchartrain-institute/">UNO Pontchartrain Institute of Environmental Sciences,</a> and <a href="http://www.west8.nl/">West8</a>.  It is uncertain when the winner will be announced.</p>
<p>The project was funded through a donor-advised fund of the <a href="http://www.gnof.org/">Greater New Orleans Foundation</a> which represented these funding partners: The <a href="http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.shell.us/">Shell</a> Oil Company, <a href="http://www.bluemoonfund.org/">blue moon fund,</a> The <a href="http://kresge.org/">Kresge Foundation</a>, and The <a href="http://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/">Walton Family Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>CSS is part of one of three final teams competing in the Changing Course Competition. Our team (Moffatt &amp; Nichol Team, which included Deltares, Maritime Institute of Technology and Graduate Studies, RAND Corporation, UNO Pontchartrain Institute of Environmental Sciences, and West8) was chosen after a global search, the three finalist teams competed in the first phase of a design competition that will involve developing solutions to restore the delta&#8217;s degraded ecosystem. These teams are challenged to create innovative, implementable solutions that will build on the State&#8217;s Master Plan. Each team&#8217;s preferred design for the Lower Mississippi River system is working to maximize the use of the River&#8217;s freshwater and sediment for land-building while achieving the best outcomes for navigation, ecosystem restoration, flood management, socio-economic issues, and sustainable community. One or more of these teams will be selected to advance to a second phase in the spring of 2015 in which plans will be furthered refined.</p>
<p>The independent design initiative—led by leaders in Louisiana’s civic, industry, and academic communities along with national experts in coastal resiliency, engineering, and design—hopes to contribute additional innovation, competition, and private sector engagement to inform Louisiana’s next Coastal Master Plan slated for 2017.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the first year of the CSS, our primary project area was the Central Wetlands Unit and the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina’s disproportionate toll on the Lower 9th Ward was directly related to the pre-existing environmental degradation of the natural environment surrounding New Orleans.</p>
<p>The cypress forest that once protected the city from storm surges was extensive, encompassing 30,000 acres. Since the construction of the MRGO, the entire forest has died and turned to open water. The Lower 9th Ward suffered especially extensive damage — and many deaths — from the post-Katrina flooding caused by the failure of the Industrial Canal, which passes through the area. Five years later the neighborhood is still struggling to rebuild.</p>
<p>Our design is driven by the concept of a robust wetland zone that supports a resilient natural environment alongside sustained human settlement. The northern part of the Lower 9th is transformed to optimize its location on the water’s edge. Dense housing and community buildings are concentrated in infrastructural corridors; schools and other institutions benefit from the wetland. Large open spaces provide opportunities for urban agriculture and stormwater retention.</p>
<p>The wetland is neither a void nor buffer but a rich locus for a new kind of neighborhood — one that builds on the long Louisiana tradition of living with water.</p>
<p>Over the course of this year a team of architecture, landscape architecture, coastal ecology, economics, and engineering faculty and students have designed new strategies for this region’s future. This comprehensive view ranges from the neighborhood to the region and showcases the interrelationships that extend across different scales.</p>
<p>Community outreach is continuing on this project with our community partner Center for Sustainable Engagement and Design (CSED).</p>
