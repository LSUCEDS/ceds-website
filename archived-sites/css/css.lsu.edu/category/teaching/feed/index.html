<p>The CSS is leading the effort to develop the LSU undergraduate Delta Research Minor, a new multidisciplinary program of study representing courses and instruction from the LSU School of the <a href="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/beach-survery.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6120 alignleft" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/beach-survery.jpg" alt="beach survery" width="244" height="177" /></a>Coast &amp; Environment, College of Engineering, and College of Art &amp; Design.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Students attending LSU are studying within the living laboratory of the Mississippi delta and Louisiana coast, one of the most distinctive, complex, and culturally rich environments in the nation. Built around a collaborative, &#8220;design thinking&#8221; methodology, this program will focus on coastal issues and distinct but interrelated components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Coastal Systems Ecology + Ecosystem Design (OCS 2050)</em></li>
<li><em>Field Methods in the Louisiana Landscape (ENGR 3050)</em></li>
<li><em>Integrated Design Thinking (ARCH 4444)</em></li>
<li><em>Project Development Seminar + Symposium in Coastal Sustainability (Independent Study)</em></li>
<li><em>Faculty-Mentored Final Research Project (Independent Study)</em></li>
<li><em>Professional Internship</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed program will begin in Spring 2016, kicking off with the <em>Coastal Systems Ecology + Ecosystem Design</em> course.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To successfully complete the program, the courses must be taken in sequential order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Project Goals + Broader Impacts</em></strong></p>

<p>The program will also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote distinctive learning</li>
<li>Promote research experience in science, engineering, and the liberal arts</li>
<li>Foster new levels of student engagement and understanding, especially through active learning and collaborative curriculum development</li>
<li>Expand interdisciplinary activities in balance with needs of each discipline</li>
<li>Incorporate research activities into the curriculum and raise the bar of expectations regarding publications and presentations by undergraduates</li>
<li>Enhance science and technology literacy for students in all disciplines</li>
<li>Develop new ways to stimulate critical thinking and other core competencies of a liberal arts education<em>                                         </em></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #3f4449;">Visiting assistant professor Shelby Doyle is working with Kiel Moe, assistant professor of Harvard Graduate School of Design, in teaching the Spring 2015 studio ARCH 7004. The focus of this studio, “Architecture of (Wet)Land Building: Wax Lake Delta NERRS Research Center,” is to propose designs for the flagship Louisiana National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) facility in the Wax Lake Delta, to be part of the national system that protects more than 1.3 million acres in 28 reserves in 22 states and Puerto Rico. Louisiana is currently the only Gulf Coast state without a NERRS site or facility. The 35,000-square-foot facility will include office space, laboratories, classrooms, exhibition space, and a dormitory—as well as a program for educational outreach.</span></p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Every summer, hypoxia (defined as dissolved oxygen below 2 mg/L) threatens the economic and ecological vitality of the northern Gulf of Mexico, the nation’s largest and most productive fishery. Over the course of 12 months, the team will develop a new nutrient management plan for the Mississippi – Atchafalaya River Basin and northern Gulf of Mexico. The team will also create a graduate research design studio, LA 4008, in the Spring of 2015 that will build upon hypoxia data. Students will map and analyze the Basin and Gulf in order to provide varied yet comparable layers that can be overlaid and shaped as part of an interdisciplinary design workshop.</p>

<p><i>ARCH 7004 Losing Ground: Methods fo</i><em>r Leeville</em> is the fourth architecture studio in the six-studio sequence Master of Architecture Program at LSU. The LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio provided financial, planning, and institutional support for this course. The course website and student methods for Leeville can be found <a href="http://methodsforleeville.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><em>Team<br />
</em>Shelby Doyle – Visiting Assistant Professor, School of Architecture<em><br />
</em>Graduate Students in ARCH 7004 class<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>The studio examined the small coastal town of Leeville, Louisiana as a surrogate for towns throughout the Gulf South. Leeville is not protected by the levee system and is exposed to the impacts of a changing climate, coastal land loss, and increasingly violent storm events. Each student produced a method for Leeville, using drawing, photography, video, writing, and modeling. These methods aim to reconsider the conceptual framework for the future of small towns often overlooked in discussions of urbanism.</p>
<p>Leeville, once a stopping point on LA-1, is now bypassed by the recently elevated highway which will eventually connect Port Fourchon directly to Golden Meadow, behind the levee, completely isolating Leeville. Bounded to the east by Bayou Lafourche the town remains an important ice production post for the commercial and recreational fishing industries. Once home to orange groves and cotton fields the footprint of the Leeville has given way to wetlands (see USGS Map Plates). Amenities such as the post office, bank, and school have relocated to Golden Meadow. Thirty permanent residents remain, others commute from Golden Meadow to work, and during the recreational fishing season the population grows to several hundred temporary residents.</p>

</a>This year&#8217;s class of summer interns have come from across the United States to work in the CSS. Graduate students from planning, landscape architecture, architecture, geography, coastal science, and engineering are working together to learn the complexities and challenges facing coastal Louisiana. Each student brings experiences from his or her university, region, community, and discipline making for a lively dialogue. The students are working in teams on a number of ongoing projects in the studio. Under the direction of our team of research fellows students are making significant contributions to our research.</p>
<p>Part of the program includes a series of field trips. A few weeks ago the group traveled deep into the coastal wetland to the Wax Lake Delta. Yesterday the trip was New Orleans and a series of stops to view the different flood control tools and infrastructure that the city depends upon.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">• Ursula Emery-McClure – Professor of Architecture<br />
• Architecture graduate students</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">www.symbioticshorebase.com</p>
<p style="color: #000000;" align="JUSTIFY">In this new graduate studio course design, architecture students are investigating symbiotic design queries in the unique Louisiana condition, including developing new schematic designs for the Chevron Shorebase in Venice, Louisiana allowing it to create a symbiotic relationship with its environment.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Louisiana has the greatest concentration of crude oil refineries, natural gas processing plants, and petrochemical production facilities in the western hemisphere. The industry must occupy the coast for its shoreline and off-shore components, and it employs thousands of people who need to live along the coast to access their work environment. The bases provide the necessary link between land and sea, humankind and livelihood, country and economy, supply and distribution. They are also located in a dynamic and eroding coastal condition and paradoxically demand a place of permanence. While industry has eroded the coast, it is also part of humans’ means of existence. This studio demands that industry be the third symbiont in the symbiotic relationship: INDUSTRY + HUMANS + COAST = Symbiotic Environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This week a major component of the CSS&#8217;s drive towards revitalization of our coastal wetlands begins with the first day of a new trans-disciplinary course at LSU. <a title="Disturbed Systems" href="http://css.lsu.edu/disturbed-sites/">&#8220;Disturbed Systems&#8221;</a> is a multi-level class in which geologists, environmental managers, and landscape architects will come together to design a coastal restoration project for Cheniere Caminada, a regressive beach ridge plain in Southeast Louisiana which has undergone significant changes in recent history due to human interaction.</div>

<div>The design projects chosen by student teams will start by first defining and then critically evaluating the variety of ecological and man-made systems at work in varying scales on the site. The students will then address this layered issue by offering design guidelines and a vision for intervention that seeks to revitalize this unique piece of coastal Wetlands.</div>
<div>
<div>This is the first course of it&#8217;s kind being offered at the school, using the trans-disciplinary working methods of the CSS  as model for collaboration.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning from Lafitte takes a trans-disciplinary approach to the examination of relationships between the built, natural and cultural environments of the Jean Lafitte area, 35 minutes south of New Orleans by car, in the Barataria Basin. At the core of the project’s research proposals and studios, run in conjunction with the LSU School of Architecture, is the development of place-based resiliency strategies; with emphasis on environmental systems and services, and community service and engagement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Comprised of independent scholarly research and two architectural studios: a fourth year undergraduate service-learning studio &#8220;Barataria Exchange&#8221; and a second year graduate level studio focused on environmental systems &#8220;Learning from Lafitte&#8221;, the project leverages the expertise of Lafitte residents, academics, social activists, historical precedents/research, and students through in-depth exploration of the geography’s complex systemic coastal issues. In the Fall 2010 term, the Barataria Exchange Studio challenged students to reexamine operations of place via unconventional oppositions of &#8220;inside vs. outside&#8221; and &#8220;natural vs. artificial&#8221; through an intense five-stage process: creating a common language, engagement, reflection, re-engagement and critique. Ultimately resulting in the development of proposals and a trans-disciplinary pedagogy for design education, the project expands the application of architectural studio and disciplinary strategies as a framework for engaging multiple communities and types of knowledge through design process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Project proposals and paradigm are disseminated through academic peer-reviewed publications and lectures, and in regular meetings and presentations with the Mayor, Council(wo)men and residents of Lafitte. Additionally, as a mechanism to further the project’s outcomes, an experimental Zine publication, designed for distribution within the town of Jean Lafitte and targeted parties within the region’s resiliency and academic communities, catalyzes sophisticated dialogue between diverse stakeholders.</p>
