				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Foundation for Louisiana awarded to the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) a $10,000 grant in support of the August 16-18, 2017, Louisiana Community Resilience Institute Recovery and Resilience Workshop on behalf of elected officials from Louisiana communities impacted by August 2016 flooding. The following workshop participants will develop and strengthen creative strategies to improve community recovery, resilience, and advancement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome of Baton Rouge</li>
<li>Mayor Darnell Waites of Baker</li>
<li>Mayor Michael Lambert of Sorrento</li>
<li>Ouachita Parish Police Juror Jack Clampit</li>
<li>Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller</li>
<li>Mayor David McCreary of Livingston</li>
</ul>
<p>During the LCRI Recovery &amp; Resilience workshop, these elected officials will work with nationally-renowned planning, architecture, landscape architecture, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals to develop projects that will help their flooded communities approach recovery challenges through resilient community design.  Objectives for this small, closed-door workshop are to provide elected officials a better understanding of the role design, planning, and hazard mitigation play in improving community resilience; and to substantially increase a community leader’s capacity to tackle complex issues and define solutions by providing a repertoire of ideas tailored specifically for his/her community. In addition to community-specific work sessions, the workshop will include discussions by professionals and resource agencies on designing resilient cities in increasingly dynamic environments.</p>
<p>The workshop is made possible through the generous support of the LSU CSS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Louisiana Office of Community Development – Disaster Recovery Unit, the Foundation for Louisiana, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation, and the Chevron Gulf of Mexico Business Unit.</p>

<p style="color: #000000;">Every summer, hypoxia (defined as dissolved oxygen below 2 mg/L) threatens the economic and ecological vitality of the northern Gulf of Mexico, the nation’s largest and most productive fishery. Over the course of 12 months, the team will develop a new nutrient management plan for the Mississippi – Atchafalaya River Basin and northern Gulf of Mexico. The team will also create a graduate research design studio, LA 4008, in the Spring of 2015 that will build upon hypoxia data. Students will map and analyze the Basin and Gulf in order to provide varied yet comparable layers that can be overlaid and shaped as part of an interdisciplinary design workshop.</p>

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of CSEB systems as hurricane-resistent low-cost housing. The goal will be achieved through the design of a proof-of-concept CSEB house on Louisiana’s coast. This proof-of-concept design will include engineering calculations, architectural drawings, and cost estimates, as well as their comparison with a traditionally built house in the same coastal environment. The research results will be disseminated through the CSS website and technical papers, and will form the groundwork for an NSF proposal.</p>

The ways in which several non-stationary forcings exert significant influence on the landscape and the feasibility of coastal restoration remain under-examined. These parameters include sea level rise, hurricane intensity, Mississippi River discharge, patterns of water level variability, energy cost, and biogeomorphic status of the coast.</p>

<p><em>Target Goals<br />
</em>Confirm the family of assumptions that underlie projections for cost and wetland-building effectiveness in the existing 2012 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan. Investigate assumptions about the future of the Mississippi River delta and the people who live in it and depend upon it using powerful novel statistical forecasting tools. Assess the sensitivity of the Coastal Master Plan analysis to variability around implicit and explicit assumptions, as well as the possible importance of factors not considered that are from more recently published trajectories of climate change and energy availability. Test the utility of a range of statistical forecasting models for decision-support, and determine whether different forecasting models converge on one or more optimal restoration implementation sequences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The project team is working to develop a smartphone reference application for commercial fishermen to use both onshore and offshore in the Vermilion Bay area, a major commercial fishing region. When a hurricane is in the forecast, this app will provide information to commercial fishermen to increase their storm preparedness and to make plans to seek harbor of refuge. Outside of hurricane season, several other datasets exist to provide more information about the waterways to commercial fishermen. The expected impact from this project is to develop the technology for commercial fishermen to access various datasets through one viewing platform on their mobile device. The project seeks to include NOAA navigational charts, weather information, observed and predicted tide information, historical storm surge simulations, and fishery related data (i.e., oyster areas, shrimp zones). While focused on Vermilion Bay, the app is being developed with scalability for the entire coast.<img class="wp-image-5735 alignright" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WAVE-Photo-620x1100.png" alt="WAVE Photo" width="217" height="386" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CSS has selected 4 teams of LSU researchers for funding through our New Projects Fund. The Fund supports innovative research, design, and outreach projects that involve collaboration between a variety of academic perspectives. The goal of the Fund is to contribute to adaptive, resilient, and sustainable human communities in the dynamic Louisiana coastal landscape.</p>
<p><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/feasibility-study-for-low-cost-hurricane-resistant-buildings-made-of-earth-blocks/" target="_blank"><strong>Feasibility Study for Low-Cost Hurricane-Resistant Residential Buildings Made of Earth Blocks</strong></a><br />
<em>Award: </em>$35,000<br />
The team will perform a feasibility study of a new low-cost hurricane-resistant residential construction system from the points of view of structural strength, architectural aesthetics, and economics. The project has the potential to provide housing opportunities for low-income Louisiana families residing in hurricane-prone coastal areas.</p>
<p><em>Team:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Michele Barbato – Associate Professor, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering</li>
<li>Robert Holton – Assistant Professor, Architecture</li>
<li>Ashok K. Mishra – Donald E. Welge Endowned Professor, Agricultural Economics &amp; Agribusiness</li>

<em>Award: </em>$10,000<br />
Every summer, hypoxia (defined as dissolved oxygen below 2 mg/L) threatens the economic and ecological vitality of the northern Gulf of Mexico, the nation’s largest and most productive fishery. The team will create a graduate design research studio, LA 4008, in the Spring of 2015 that will build upon hypoxia data. Students will map and analyze the Basin and Gulf in order to provide varied yet comparable layers that can be overlaid and shaped as part of an interdisciplinary design workshop.</p>

</ul>
<p><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/megatrends-dynamic-coast/" target="_blank"><strong>Megatrends – Dynamic Coast</strong></a><br />
<em>Award: </em>$22,660<br />
The project is concerned with statistical scenario modeling of emerging megatrends to optimize the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of coastal restoration in the Mississippi River Delta. The team will use an innovative combination of statistical techniques to (1) confirm the assumptions that underlie the projections for cost and wetland-building effectiveness in the 2012 Louisiana Coastal Master Plan; (2) asses the sensitivity of the Plan’s analysis to variability around implicit and explicit assumptions, as well as the possible importance of factors not considered; (3) test the utility to a range of statistical forecasting models for decision-support and determine whether different forecasting models converge on one or more optimal restoration implementation sequences.</p>
