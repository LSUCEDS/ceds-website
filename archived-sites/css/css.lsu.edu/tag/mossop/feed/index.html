				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the first year of the CSS, our primary project area was the Central Wetlands Unit and the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina’s disproportionate toll on the Lower 9th Ward was directly related to the pre-existing environmental degradation of the natural environment surrounding New Orleans.</p>
<p>The cypress forest that once protected the city from storm surges was extensive, encompassing 30,000 acres. Since the construction of the MRGO, the entire forest has died and turned to open water. The Lower 9th Ward suffered especially extensive damage — and many deaths — from the post-Katrina flooding caused by the failure of the Industrial Canal, which passes through the area. Five years later the neighborhood is still struggling to rebuild.</p>
<p>Our design is driven by the concept of a robust wetland zone that supports a resilient natural environment alongside sustained human settlement. The northern part of the Lower 9th is transformed to optimize its location on the water’s edge. Dense housing and community buildings are concentrated in infrastructural corridors; schools and other institutions benefit from the wetland. Large open spaces provide opportunities for urban agriculture and stormwater retention.</p>
<p>The wetland is neither a void nor buffer but a rich locus for a new kind of neighborhood — one that builds on the long Louisiana tradition of living with water.</p>
<p>Over the course of this year a team of architecture, landscape architecture, coastal ecology, economics, and engineering faculty and students have designed new strategies for this region’s future. This comprehensive view ranges from the neighborhood to the region and showcases the interrelationships that extend across different scales.</p>
<p>Community outreach is continuing on this project with our community partner Center for Sustainable Engagement and Design (CSED).</p>
