				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the first year of the CSS, our primary project area was the Central Wetlands Unit and the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina’s disproportionate toll on the Lower 9th Ward was directly related to the pre-existing environmental degradation of the natural environment surrounding New Orleans.</p>
<p>The cypress forest that once protected the city from storm surges was extensive, encompassing 30,000 acres. Since the construction of the MRGO, the entire forest has died and turned to open water. The Lower 9th Ward suffered especially extensive damage — and many deaths — from the post-Katrina flooding caused by the failure of the Industrial Canal, which passes through the area. Five years later the neighborhood is still struggling to rebuild.</p>
<p>Our design is driven by the concept of a robust wetland zone that supports a resilient natural environment alongside sustained human settlement. The northern part of the Lower 9th is transformed to optimize its location on the water’s edge. Dense housing and community buildings are concentrated in infrastructural corridors; schools and other institutions benefit from the wetland. Large open spaces provide opportunities for urban agriculture and stormwater retention.</p>
<p>The wetland is neither a void nor buffer but a rich locus for a new kind of neighborhood — one that builds on the long Louisiana tradition of living with water.</p>
<p>Over the course of this year a team of architecture, landscape architecture, coastal ecology, economics, and engineering faculty and students have designed new strategies for this region’s future. This comprehensive view ranges from the neighborhood to the region and showcases the interrelationships that extend across different scales.</p>
<p>Community outreach is continuing on this project with our community partner Center for Sustainable Engagement and Design (CSED).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The French introduced a unit of land division, known as the arpent or long lot system, to Louisiana during the 18th century. Since then, residents along the waterways of coastal Louisiana have adapted this original mode of settlement to suit the changing environmental and social landscape of the region. Measured Change: Tracking Transformations on Bayou Lafourche brings together a multidisciplinary team of scholars who are committed to understanding how such a resilient system of land management can help current inhabitants face future challenges to coastal living. Bayou Lafourche, the project’s primary site of investigation, is one among several waterways in the Mississippi Delta with a deep dependence on the long lot system, as well as a history of constructing canals and levees that have dramatically affected the economic potential and cultural fabric of Louisiana. By understanding the intricacies of life along Bayou Lafourche, we add to our knowledge of how people dwell on land and with water in sustainable ways.</div>
<p dir="ltr">Bayou Lafourche and the arpent system, while unique to Louisiana in many important ways, are also representative of the adaptability of coastal communities to momentous environmental and social changes that span centuries and cross continents. The prototypical quality of Bayou Lafourche is reinforced by the region’s proven capacity for flexibility and rigidity at key moments of transformation, such as hurricanes, floods, technological innovations, industrial developments, coastal erosion, and economic cycles of boom and bust. Moreover, the potential application of this project to other places suggests ways to collaborate across academic disciplines and geographic areas of investigation that hinge on the crucial relationship between people, land, and water. Reference to recent literature and practice, as well as how this can be used in designing places and teaching about place.</p>
