				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The CSS recently attended the <a href="http://www.stateofthecoast.org/">2012 State of the Coast Conference in New Orleans</a>. This bi-annual conference was attended by around 800 people including Louisiana and the Gulf&#8217;s leaders in restoration, protection, politics, and education. Following the 2012 masterplan the conference had a buzz about it that was quite exciting. You can tell that things are about to change for the Gulf!</p>
<p>The CSS had a booth designed and run by our students. It included a dramatic vision of Louisiana as part of an infrastructure network that links us to the rest of the world. Additionally we featured a number of our projects on boards and the video screen.</p>
<p>At the Conference Jeff Carney presented a paper titled, &#8220;Achieving Stable Communities in an Unstable Landscape: The Louisiana Resiliency Assistance Program&#8221;. The presentation discussed the project with OCD-DRU that the CSS has been working on over the past few months. See more about the project here: <a href="http://resiliency.lsu.edu/">http://resiliency.lsu.edu/</a></p>
