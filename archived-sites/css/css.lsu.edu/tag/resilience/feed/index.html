				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Foundation for Louisiana awarded to the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) a $10,000 grant in support of the August 16-18, 2017, Louisiana Community Resilience Institute Recovery and Resilience Workshop on behalf of elected officials from Louisiana communities impacted by August 2016 flooding. The following workshop participants will develop and strengthen creative strategies to improve community recovery, resilience, and advancement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome of Baton Rouge</li>
<li>Mayor Darnell Waites of Baker</li>
<li>Mayor Michael Lambert of Sorrento</li>
<li>Ouachita Parish Police Juror Jack Clampit</li>
<li>Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller</li>
<li>Mayor David McCreary of Livingston</li>
</ul>
<p>During the LCRI Recovery &amp; Resilience workshop, these elected officials will work with nationally-renowned planning, architecture, landscape architecture, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals to develop projects that will help their flooded communities approach recovery challenges through resilient community design.  Objectives for this small, closed-door workshop are to provide elected officials a better understanding of the role design, planning, and hazard mitigation play in improving community resilience; and to substantially increase a community leader’s capacity to tackle complex issues and define solutions by providing a repertoire of ideas tailored specifically for his/her community. In addition to community-specific work sessions, the workshop will include discussions by professionals and resource agencies on designing resilient cities in increasingly dynamic environments.</p>
<p>The workshop is made possible through the generous support of the LSU CSS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Louisiana Office of Community Development – Disaster Recovery Unit, the Foundation for Louisiana, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation, and the Chevron Gulf of Mexico Business Unit.</p>

The team plans to collect data by interviewing residents about their concerns and priorities regarding the role of government in helping them relocate, should they decide to move.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 15-17, 2017, the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) hosted the Louisiana Community Resilience Institute (LCRI) Recovery and Resiliency Workshop in Alexandria, Louisiana, on behalf of five elected officials from Louisiana communities flooded during the spring of 2016.  In preparation for the event, CSS worked directly with each official to decide on a single local community challenge and possible project to bring to the workshop for analysis and feedback from peers and subject matter experts. Participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayor Wendy O’Quin Perrette of Bogalusa</li>
<li>Mayor Roland Smith of Campti</li>
<li>Mayor Jamie Mayo of Monroe</li>
<li>Natchitoches Parish President Rick Nowlin</li>
<li>Mayor Dave Norris of West Monroe</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7190" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-601x400.jpg 601w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-1277x850.jpg 1277w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3.jpg 1429w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>During the workshop, elected officials were paired with six nationally-renowned planning, urban design, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals to work one-on-one and in the peer group setting on potential community projects.  Following the workshop, mayors returned home better equipped for real world prob­lem-solving, possessing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of community design and planning processes</li>
<li>Substantially increased confidence in their ability to tackle complex issues</li>
<li>A support network of experienced political peers</li>
<li>Access to subject matter experts and new community resilience resources</li>
<li>A repertoire of ideas and and/or well-defined solutions tailored specif­ically to community challenges</li>
<li>Funding and partnership ideas to help solve community problems</li>
</ul>
