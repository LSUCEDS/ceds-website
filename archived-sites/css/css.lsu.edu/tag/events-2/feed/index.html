				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Caritas for a Coastal-Carnival Place: Creating a Theology of Care Within Post-Katrina New Orleans</em></strong></p>
<p>On November 21, 2013, Anne Daniell presented ideas toward a constructive theology of “care” within the renewing and yet troubled place of New Orleans, a city created through coalescence of its coastal wetlands geology and its cultural performance traditions. Anne Daniell received her PhD in Religious and Theological Studies from Drew University, where she focused on Ecological Theology, Feminist Theology, and the intersection of Process Theology and Post-Modern Thought. Her most recent theological work concerns “theology of place,” which considers both how eco-cultural places shape religiosity and how constructive theological thinking, in turn, could help us to think about and care for the places we inhabit. She is now an Instructor of Religious Studies at Loyola University College of Humanities &amp; Natural Science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A Method for Knowledge Integration and Mapping to Inform and Enhance Future Coastal Planning and Implementation Efforts</em></p>
<p><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/2013/10/matthew-bethel-lecture/matthew-bethel/" rel="attachment wp-att-4261"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4261" title="matthew bethel" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/matthew-bethel.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Making more informed coastal restoration and hazard mitigation decisions has become increasingly important given limited resources available for restoration and hazard mitigation projects, and the increasing magnitude of marsh degradation and loss across the Gulf of Mexico coast. An interdisciplinary team of physical and social scientists, State and Federal agency coastal managers, and fishers/resource harvesters of affected coastal communities collaborated on related studies with the goal of aiding restoration and hazard mitigation decision making by engaging local ecosystem knowledge holders in the process. Together they investigated the feasibility and benefits of integrating the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of coastal populations with geospatial technology and scientific datasets to assess how the integrated knowledge that results might inform project planning for coastal restoration and hazard mitigation. Through these collaborative efforts, a more comprehensive and transferrable method of assessing localized stakeholder priorities and translating that information into a format compatible with existing coastal hazard mitigation and restoration decision-support tools was developed. The process developed involves recording TEK in a natural, egalitarian setting which is then converted into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) models that can be incorporated into the existing decision-making processes. This is achieved by using Remote Sensing (RS) data, other science-based datasets, and GIS to produce mapping products that represent the local fishers’ and harvesters’ TEK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bethel earned his doctorate from the University of New Orleans in engineering and applied sciences, with a concentration in environmental sciences. He completed his Master of Science degree in geoscience at Murray State University in Murray, KY and his Bachelor of Science degree in geography from the University of Tennessee in Martin, TN.</p>
