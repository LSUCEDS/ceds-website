				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The French introduced a unit of land division, known as the arpent or long lot system, to Louisiana during the 18th century. Since then, residents along the waterways of coastal Louisiana have adapted this original mode of settlement to suit the changing environmental and social landscape of the region. Measured Change: Tracking Transformations on Bayou Lafourche brings together a multidisciplinary team of scholars who are committed to understanding how such a resilient system of land management can help current inhabitants face future challenges to coastal living. Bayou Lafourche, the project’s primary site of investigation, is one among several waterways in the Mississippi Delta with a deep dependence on the long lot system, as well as a history of constructing canals and levees that have dramatically affected the economic potential and cultural fabric of Louisiana. By understanding the intricacies of life along Bayou Lafourche, we add to our knowledge of how people dwell on land and with water in sustainable ways.</div>
<p dir="ltr">Bayou Lafourche and the arpent system, while unique to Louisiana in many important ways, are also representative of the adaptability of coastal communities to momentous environmental and social changes that span centuries and cross continents. The prototypical quality of Bayou Lafourche is reinforced by the region’s proven capacity for flexibility and rigidity at key moments of transformation, such as hurricanes, floods, technological innovations, industrial developments, coastal erosion, and economic cycles of boom and bust. Moreover, the potential application of this project to other places suggests ways to collaborate across academic disciplines and geographic areas of investigation that hinge on the crucial relationship between people, land, and water. Reference to recent literature and practice, as well as how this can be used in designing places and teaching about place.</p>
