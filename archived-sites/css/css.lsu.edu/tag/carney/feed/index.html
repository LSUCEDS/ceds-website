				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CHANGING COURSE NEWS RELEASE</p>
<p><strong>Global Design Competition Presents 100-Year Visions for Restoring and Sustaining Louisiana’s Eroding Coast</strong></p>
<p><em>Designs Offer Solutions to Rebuild Mississippi River Delta, Protect Communities and Industries</em></p>
<p>(NEW ORLEANS – August 20, 2015) The international <a href="http://changingcourse.us/">Changing Course</a> design competition today announced its winning teams and the teams’ 100-year visions for restoring and sustaining the Mississippi River Delta for the people and industries that call it home. The winning teams – comprised of some of the world’s top engineers, coastal scientists, planners and designers – are <a href="http://www.deltaforall.com">Baird and Associates</a>, <a href="http://www.moffattnichol.com/">Moffatt and Nichol<strong> &#8211; </strong></a><a href="http://west8.com/" target="_blank">West 8</a><a href="http://www.moffattnichol.com/"> &#8211;</a><a href="http://css.lsu.edu/" target="_blank">LSU-CSS team</a>, and <a href="http://www.h3studio.com/misi-ziibi-1/">Studio Misi-Ziibi</a>.</p>
<p>“We challenged the world’s top experts to find the most innovative ways to make sure that New Orleans and southeast Louisiana aren’t held hostage to worsening storms, rising seas and a disappearing delta,” said Steve Cochran, Associate Vice President of Ecosystems at <a href="http://www.edf.org/">Environmental Defense Fund</a> and a member of the Changing Course Leadership Team. “We hope the winning ideas will help citizens, communities, industries and governments engage in real conversations about what it’s going to take to make this important region more resilient and prosperous.”</p>
<p>The winning teams’ designs are based on a 100-year planning horizon and focus on maximizing the Mississippi River’s natural and sustainable land-building potential while taking into the account of needs of navigation and other industries, flood control and sustainable community development – a challenge raised by the state of Louisiana’s master planning process.</p>
<p>“Because of the quality of the work, the State has committed to bringing the technical work from Changing Course into its process of analyzing the management scheme for the Lower Mississippi River, said Kyle Graham, Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority Executive Director.  “We look forward to working with the teams.”</p>
<p>Over the last century, nearly 1,900 square miles of Louisiana’s coastal wetlands have vanished. Every hour, a football field-sized swath of land drowns in the Gulf’s advancing tides. At this rate, by 2100, Louisiana’s protective coast will be gone. The solutions proposed by the winning teams focus primarily on the Mississippi River south of New Orleans.</p>
<p>While each of the winning teams offered a different vision, all three identified three major themes as critical to sustaining the Mississippi River Delta today and into the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear focus on a sustainable delta through using the natural forces of the Mississippi River;</li>
<li>Maximum integration of navigation, flood control and restoration, including consideration of ideas for a better and more sustainable navigation channel;</li>
<li> Consideration of a gradual transition of industry and communities into more protected and resilient communities, over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As sea levels rise, communities around the world, particularly in major river deltas, need novel approaches to find sustainable solutions.  Changing Course is a great example of how world class expertise can be combined with local wisdom to produce ideas that work.”  said Dr. Don Boesch Changing Course leadership team member and Professor of Marine Science and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week Jeff Carney, Kristi Cheramie, and Bradley Cantrell traveled to Cambridge to present research related to the Louisiana Gulf Coast. Together with Dan Ethridge, Jonathan Tate, and Ann Yoachim from Tulane, the group presented a diverse but interconnected series of visions for the Gulf Coast. Jeff started the conversation with a talk titled, &#8220;Behind the Changing Coast: The Mega-Region and the Masterplan&#8221;. The talk looked at the Gulf region from the distinctive thematic lenses established by the megaregion and the masterplan. Kristi Cheramie followed with a talk that brought the focus to the human scale of change. Her presentation titled, &#8220;Reconciliations from Post Eden: Dismantling the Monster with Objects and Infrastructure&#8221; considered the disconnection from the coast felt by many residents who live just on the other side of a levee. Kristi&#8217;s work chronicles a longing for the coast through a collection and analysis of objects and coastal memory of residents. Brad Cantrell followed with a talk titled, &#8220;Mapping Ecological Change through a Conditional Preservation&#8221; about the CSS project that he and Professor Emery-McClure recently completed on Fort Proctor. The talk examined the method and vision that the team developed to document historic structures in a changing landscape.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfJgxv0nMkI&amp;feature=g-all-u">The entirety of the talk can be viewed on the video.</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The French introduced a unit of land division, known as the arpent or long lot system, to Louisiana during the 18th century. Since then, residents along the waterways of coastal Louisiana have adapted this original mode of settlement to suit the changing environmental and social landscape of the region. Measured Change: Tracking Transformations on Bayou Lafourche brings together a multidisciplinary team of scholars who are committed to understanding how such a resilient system of land management can help current inhabitants face future challenges to coastal living. Bayou Lafourche, the project’s primary site of investigation, is one among several waterways in the Mississippi Delta with a deep dependence on the long lot system, as well as a history of constructing canals and levees that have dramatically affected the economic potential and cultural fabric of Louisiana. By understanding the intricacies of life along Bayou Lafourche, we add to our knowledge of how people dwell on land and with water in sustainable ways.</div>
<p dir="ltr">Bayou Lafourche and the arpent system, while unique to Louisiana in many important ways, are also representative of the adaptability of coastal communities to momentous environmental and social changes that span centuries and cross continents. The prototypical quality of Bayou Lafourche is reinforced by the region’s proven capacity for flexibility and rigidity at key moments of transformation, such as hurricanes, floods, technological innovations, industrial developments, coastal erosion, and economic cycles of boom and bust. Moreover, the potential application of this project to other places suggests ways to collaborate across academic disciplines and geographic areas of investigation that hinge on the crucial relationship between people, land, and water. Reference to recent literature and practice, as well as how this can be used in designing places and teaching about place.</p>
