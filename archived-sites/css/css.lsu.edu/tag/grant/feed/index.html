				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Foundation for Louisiana awarded to the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) a $10,000 grant in support of the August 16-18, 2017, Louisiana Community Resilience Institute Recovery and Resilience Workshop on behalf of elected officials from Louisiana communities impacted by August 2016 flooding. The following workshop participants will develop and strengthen creative strategies to improve community recovery, resilience, and advancement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome of Baton Rouge</li>
<li>Mayor Darnell Waites of Baker</li>
<li>Mayor Michael Lambert of Sorrento</li>
<li>Ouachita Parish Police Juror Jack Clampit</li>
<li>Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller</li>
<li>Mayor David McCreary of Livingston</li>
</ul>
<p>During the LCRI Recovery &amp; Resilience workshop, these elected officials will work with nationally-renowned planning, architecture, landscape architecture, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals to develop projects that will help their flooded communities approach recovery challenges through resilient community design.  Objectives for this small, closed-door workshop are to provide elected officials a better understanding of the role design, planning, and hazard mitigation play in improving community resilience; and to substantially increase a community leader’s capacity to tackle complex issues and define solutions by providing a repertoire of ideas tailored specifically for his/her community. In addition to community-specific work sessions, the workshop will include discussions by professionals and resource agencies on designing resilient cities in increasingly dynamic environments.</p>
<p>The workshop is made possible through the generous support of the LSU CSS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Louisiana Office of Community Development – Disaster Recovery Unit, the Foundation for Louisiana, the Baton Rouge Area Foundation, and the Chevron Gulf of Mexico Business Unit.</p>
