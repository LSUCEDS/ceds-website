<p>The CSS is leading the effort to develop the LSU undergraduate Delta Research Minor, a new multidisciplinary program of study representing courses and instruction from the LSU School of the <a href="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/beach-survery.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6120 alignleft" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/beach-survery.jpg" alt="beach survery" width="244" height="177" /></a>Coast &amp; Environment, College of Engineering, and College of Art &amp; Design.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Students attending LSU are studying within the living laboratory of the Mississippi delta and Louisiana coast, one of the most distinctive, complex, and culturally rich environments in the nation. Built around a collaborative, &#8220;design thinking&#8221; methodology, this program will focus on coastal issues and distinct but interrelated components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Coastal Systems Ecology + Ecosystem Design (OCS 2050)</em></li>
<li><em>Field Methods in the Louisiana Landscape (ENGR 3050)</em></li>
<li><em>Integrated Design Thinking (ARCH 4444)</em></li>
<li><em>Project Development Seminar + Symposium in Coastal Sustainability (Independent Study)</em></li>
<li><em>Faculty-Mentored Final Research Project (Independent Study)</em></li>
<li><em>Professional Internship</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The proposed program will begin in Spring 2016, kicking off with the <em>Coastal Systems Ecology + Ecosystem Design</em> course.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To successfully complete the program, the courses must be taken in sequential order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Project Goals + Broader Impacts</em></strong></p>

<p>The program will also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote distinctive learning</li>
<li>Promote research experience in science, engineering, and the liberal arts</li>
<li>Foster new levels of student engagement and understanding, especially through active learning and collaborative curriculum development</li>
<li>Expand interdisciplinary activities in balance with needs of each discipline</li>
<li>Incorporate research activities into the curriculum and raise the bar of expectations regarding publications and presentations by undergraduates</li>
<li>Enhance science and technology literacy for students in all disciplines</li>
<li>Develop new ways to stimulate critical thinking and other core competencies of a liberal arts education<em>                                         </em></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week Jeff Carney, Kristi Cheramie, and Bradley Cantrell traveled to Cambridge to present research related to the Louisiana Gulf Coast. Together with Dan Ethridge, Jonathan Tate, and Ann Yoachim from Tulane, the group presented a diverse but interconnected series of visions for the Gulf Coast. Jeff started the conversation with a talk titled, &#8220;Behind the Changing Coast: The Mega-Region and the Masterplan&#8221;. The talk looked at the Gulf region from the distinctive thematic lenses established by the megaregion and the masterplan. Kristi Cheramie followed with a talk that brought the focus to the human scale of change. Her presentation titled, &#8220;Reconciliations from Post Eden: Dismantling the Monster with Objects and Infrastructure&#8221; considered the disconnection from the coast felt by many residents who live just on the other side of a levee. Kristi&#8217;s work chronicles a longing for the coast through a collection and analysis of objects and coastal memory of residents. Brad Cantrell followed with a talk titled, &#8220;Mapping Ecological Change through a Conditional Preservation&#8221; about the CSS project that he and Professor Emery-McClure recently completed on Fort Proctor. The talk examined the method and vision that the team developed to document historic structures in a changing landscape.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfJgxv0nMkI&amp;feature=g-all-u">The entirety of the talk can be viewed on the video.</a></p>
