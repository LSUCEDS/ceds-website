				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 15-17, 2017, the LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio (CSS) hosted the Louisiana Community Resilience Institute (LCRI) Recovery and Resiliency Workshop in Alexandria, Louisiana, on behalf of five elected officials from Louisiana communities flooded during the spring of 2016.  In preparation for the event, CSS worked directly with each official to decide on a single local community challenge and possible project to bring to the workshop for analysis and feedback from peers and subject matter experts. Participants included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayor Wendy O’Quin Perrette of Bogalusa</li>
<li>Mayor Roland Smith of Campti</li>
<li>Mayor Jamie Mayo of Monroe</li>
<li>Natchitoches Parish President Rick Nowlin</li>
<li>Mayor Dave Norris of West Monroe</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7190" src="http://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-600x400.jpg 600w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-601x400.jpg 601w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3-1277x850.jpg 1277w, https://css.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/3.jpg 1429w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>During the workshop, elected officials were paired with six nationally-renowned planning, urban design, hazard mitigation, development, and engineering professionals to work one-on-one and in the peer group setting on potential community projects.  Following the workshop, mayors returned home better equipped for real world prob­lem-solving, possessing:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of community design and planning processes</li>
<li>Substantially increased confidence in their ability to tackle complex issues</li>
<li>A support network of experienced political peers</li>
<li>Access to subject matter experts and new community resilience resources</li>
<li>A repertoire of ideas and and/or well-defined solutions tailored specif­ically to community challenges</li>
<li>Funding and partnership ideas to help solve community problems</li>
</ul>

<strong>Principal<br />
Catherine Seavitt Studio<br />
</strong><strong>Associate Professor of Landscape Architecture</strong><br />
<strong>City College of New York<br />
</strong>Prof. Seavitt will speak on <em>Structures of Coastal Resiliency: Jamaica Bay</em>. Her work focuses on design adaptation to sea level rise in urban coastal environments and explores novel landscape restoration practices given the dynamics of climate change. She co-authored the book <em>On the Water: Palisade Bay</em>, a climate adaptation proposal for the New York / New Jersey Upper Harbor. This study examines the use of “soft” infrastructural systems to mitigate the impact of storm surge and was the foundation of the 2010 exhibition <a href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1031" target="_blank"><em>Rising Currents</em></a> at the Museum of Modern Art. She is currently leading research at Jamaica Bay as part of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded grant <em>Structures of Coastal Resilience</em>. She earned her MArch from Princeton University.</p>
