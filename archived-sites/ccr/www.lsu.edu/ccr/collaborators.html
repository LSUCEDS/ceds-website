                                 from the University of Notre Dame in 2010. During his time at Notre Dame, he traveled
                                 to New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and toured areas impacted by the storm.
                                 From that experience, he developed an interest in the numerical modeling of hurricane

                                 on issues of leadership and assessment: in particular, how school reform policies
                                 affect classroom practice, evaluation, and school administration. Dr. Hollingworth
                                 has served as the Director of the Center for Evaluation and Assessment since 2015,
                                 working with a team of staff and graduate students to conduct multiple forms of program
                                 evaluation in collaboration with colleges, universities, and school systems.

                                 and coastal wetlands, specifically&nbsp;how biology, geology, and water interact to create
                                 and maintain&nbsp;functioning landscapes. Her investigations focus on where and&nbsp;under what
                                 physical conditions organic and inorganic sediments&nbsp;are deposited, how these sediments
                                 are preserved, and how&nbsp;perturbations (which may be physical, biologic, or&nbsp;anthropogenic)
                                 affect these processes. In Bangladesh, her team is studying how land use changes&nbsp;from
                                 human activity (e.g., the embankment of tidal islands, deforestation) impacts the<br>distribution of water and sediment and the susceptibility of embankment failure during
                                 storm&nbsp;events. This research not only helps identify how reclaimed land impacts the
                                 natural dynamics of&nbsp;the densely-populated Ganges Brahmaputra delta and resilience
                                 to storm surges, but also&nbsp;provides information on changes of the physical environment
