			<p>
				Since our beginnings in 2005, the Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment (CERA) team at Louisiana State University has been committed to deliver highly accurate, real-time water level, wind, and wave predictions to emergency managers, decision-makers and the general public.
				It is our mission to provide critical guidance during severe weather events like incoming hurricanes and to inform a wide user community to make critical life and property decisions.
			</p>
			<p>You, our users, have inspired us to make the CERA system a valuable and useful real-time storm surge tool and we are very grateful for that.</br>
			CERA is open and free to use and it is our goal to keep it that way and make it even better.</p>

			<p><b>Please help us continue serving you!</b></br>
			If you find CERA useful, please support its future. Anything is greatly appreciated - thank you so much for your contribution.</p>
			<p>-- CERA Team @ LSU --</p>

			We at CERA have always had the user experience as our top priority. We have approached many popular crowdfunding options (Patreon, GoFundMe, Indiegogo etc.) due to their simplicity for the user. However, our team works under special rules governing academic projects. According to LSU regulations, the proper way of funding our work is the LSU Foundation CERA Support Fund. Thank you for the time and your donations!
